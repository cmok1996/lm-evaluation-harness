                    "Passage: The governor's campaign continued into May, when a second round of reinforcements arrived. The rebellion was extended to the Oecussi enclave, but without any coordination with the rebellion elsewhere. During the second phase of his offensive, da C\u00e2mara divided his reinforced army into four columns. His own column set out from Maubisse and comprised twenty Europeans, two hundred Africans and five hundred moradores. Including the arraias of allied chieftains, it contained over 4,000 troops. It also had a modern Krupp 75 mm field gun. The second column, comprising an Indian company with a Nordenfelt mitrailleuse and several hundred moradores, marched from Soibada; the third, with two Europeans, seventy Africans and two hundred moradores armed with another Nordenfelt, from Suru; and the fourth, a flying column with one hundred moradores, from the Dutch border. By the time of the final assault, da C\u00e2mara's force, the largest foreign army ever assembled at the time in Timor, contained 8,000 irregulars, 647second-line troops, 500 first-line troops and 34 officers. Something of the weakness of the native opposition can be gleaned from the record of what weaponry the Portuguese captured: 36 rifles and 590 flintlocks with a few cartridges, plus 495 swords. In general, the native Timorese possessed more spears than guns and were usually short of powder. They avoided close combat, where they were the discrepancy in guns was acutely felt, in favour of hit-and-run guerrilla tactics.\nQuestion: How many more Africans were there than Europeans?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 180, \n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Bears, the Eagles went home for a Week 13 interconference duel with the Houston Texans on Thursday night.  Philadelphia delivered the opening strike in the first quarter as quarterback Michael Vick found running back LeSean McCoy on a 1-yard touchdown pass.  The Texans replied with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 48-yard field goal, yet the Eagles answered in the second quarter with a 4-yard touchdown run from McCoy, followed by a 36-yard field goal from kicker David Akers.  Houston struck back with quarterback Matt Schaub completing an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jacoby Jones.  Philadelphia would close out the half with a 22-yard field goal from Akers. The Texans took the third quarter with running back Arian Foster catching a 13-yard touchdown pass from Schaub and running for a 3-yard touchdown run.  The Eagles regained the lead with Vick's 2-yard touchdown run and his 5-yard touchdown pass to fullback Owen Schmitt.  Afterwards, Philadelphia's defense prevented any comeback attempt from Houston.\nQuestion: How many field goals were made during the first half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3, \n\nPassage: The Burmese then laid siege to Ayutthaya city. After heavy cannon fire put a stop to Burmese attempts at digging up to the walls, the invaders began building a bridge at Koh Keo in order to access the walls from a new direction. Maha Chakkraphat died during the course of the siege, therefore his son Mahinthrathirat ascended the throne. Frequent Ayutthaya sorties once again prevented the Burmese from finishing the construction. Bayinnaung then sent an Ayutthayan noble he held captive under the guise of a deserter. Not only was the spy allowed into the city but he was also put into a position of power. On the night of 2 August 1569, the spy opened the gates of the city, bringing its downfall. Mahinthrathirat along with his family and the nobility were captured and taken to Pegu. Mahinthrathirat died in the same year on the way.:63 Ayutthaya became a Burmese vassal state, with Mahathammarachathirat as appointed king. The Burmese took several weeks to regroup and rest having taken Ayutthaya, which allowed Lan Xang to rally their forces and plan for prolonged guerrilla warfare. The Burmese arrived in Vientiane and were able to take the lightly defended city. Setthathirath began a guerrilla campaign from his base near Nam Ngum, northeast of Vientiane. In 1570 Bayinnaung retreated, Setthathirath counterattacked and more than 30,000 were taken prisoner, along with 100 elephants, and 2,300 pieces of ivory from the retreating Burmese.\nQuestion: How many years was Mahintrathirat held captive before he died?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 4, \n\nPassage:  Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Patriots, the Raiders stayed at home for a Week 16 duel with the Houston Texans.

                    "Passage: Trying to snap a six-game losing skid, the Ravens stayed at home for a Week 14 Sunday Night duel with the Indianapolis Colts in the rematch of last year's AFC Divisional game.  In the first quarter, Baltimore trailed early as Colts QB Peyton Manning completed a 34-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne, while RB Joseph Addai got a 1-yard TD run.  Afterwards, Indianapolis' Manning completed a 19-yard TD pass to Addai, while CB Michael Coe blocked a punt, causing it to go out of bounds through the Ravens' endzone for a safety.  In the second quarter, the Colts' Addai ran for an 11-yard TD run.  Baltimore responded with rookie WR Yamon Figurs returning the ensueing kickoff 94 yards for a touchdown.  Afterwards, Indianapolis struck again with Manning completing a 57-yard TD pass to WR Anthony Gonzalez. In the third quarter, the Colts' Manning completed a 40-yard TD pass to Gonzalez for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Ravens' QB Kyle Boller completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Devard Darling, while rookie QB Troy Smith got a 6-yard TD run. With their seventh-straight loss, Baltimore fell to 4-9 and to last place in the AFC North with the Bengals' win over the Rams.\nQuestion: What all touchdowns did Peyton Manning make in the second half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 40-yard\n\nPassage:  With the rest of Week 16's games being played on Christmas Eve, the Jets, due to losses by Jacksonville and Cincinnati, controlled their own playoff destiny with two victories. The game was played in a driving rainstorm as both teams struggled to move the ball early. With 49 seconds remaining in the first quarter, Mike Nugent was ready to attempt a 34-yard field goal, but holder Ben Graham could not handle the snap in the slippery conditions, and the Jets were denied. It was the second straight week Graham had flubbed a snap, but this one could be blamed on the wet conditions. The two teams would trade punts for the rest of the half. In the third quarter, Dolphins coach Nick Saban inserted backup quarterback Cleo Lemon into the game, replacing an ineffective Joey Harrington. Finally, the Jets went on a drive with 6:15 left in the third quarter, with Chad Pennington scrambling for 15 yards and moving into the Dolphins' red zone when Yeremiah Bell was flagged for pass interference. Nugent knocked in a 22-yard field goal for the first points of the game. But Lemon rallied Miami, completing two long passes to Randy McMichael and Ronnie Brown picking up a long run before Lemon tossed a 7-yard touchdown pass to McMichael, and the Dolphins led 7-3 with 13:26 left in the game. Pennington showed poise in leading the Jets back to take the lead, completing key passes to Brad Smith and Leon Washington before finding Cotchery on a 31-yard completion to the Miami 1-yard line, but the Jets challenged, saying that Cotchery was brought down after he broke the plane of the end zone, and the referee agreed, giving the Jets a 10-7 lead with 8:04 remaining in the game. Miami was then forced to punt, but caught a break when Donnie Jones' kick bounced off the elbow of Jets linebacker Brad Kassell, and long snapper John Denney recovered at the Jets' 42-yard line. Lemon led Miami downfield, completing key passes to Derek Hagan and Sammy Morris before Mare tied the game with a 25-yard field goal. With 2:09 to play, the Jets' biggest play of the season took place. Pennington flipped a short screen pass to Washington, who found a hole and scampered 64 yards down to the Miami 16-yard line. After three runs by Kevan Barlow, Nugent kicked a 30-yard field goal with 10 seconds to play, and the Jets had their biggest win of the year.\nQuestion: how many yards did Lemon toss?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 7\n\nPassage: With the game scoreless early in the first quarter, the Texans faked a punt on fourth and one from their own 42...and failed. The Patriots' Kevin Faulk converted the Texans' mistake into an 11-yard TD run. Faulk also scored on a 43-yard screen pass, and Tom Brady threw another touchdown pass, covering 6 yards to former Texan Jabar Gaffney. The Patriots' defense had four sacks and three interceptions and held the Texans to 76 yards in the first two quarters. The Texans trailed 27-0 at halftime. Ron Dayne scored on a 1-yard run on the Texans' first series of the third quarter, but Ellis Hobbs returned the ensuing kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown to put the game out of reach. David Carr turned in another poor performance completing 16-of-28 for 127 yards and four interceptions.\nQuestion: Which player had the shortest touchdown run?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Ron Dayne\n\nPassage:  Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Patriots, the Raiders stayed at home for a Week 16 duel with the Houston Texans.  Oakland would get the early lead in the first quarter as quarterback JaMarcus Russell completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Chaz Schilens.  The Texans would respond with fullback Vonta Leach getting a 1-yard touchdown run, yet the Raiders would answer with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 33-yard and a 30-yard field goal.  Houston would tie the game in the second quarter with kicker Kris Brown getting a 53-yard and a 24-yard field goal. Oakland would take the lead in the third quarter with wide receiver Johnnie Lee Higgins catching a 29-yard touchdown pass from Russell, followed up by an 80-yard punt return for a touchdown.

                    "Passage: After a tough home game against the Cowboys, the Steelers traveled to Cleveland for Game 1 against the Browns. In the first half, it was all Steelers starting in the first quarter when Chris Boswell made a 32-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead. They would increase their lead in the second quarter when Boswell made a 33-yard field goal followed up by Le'Veon Bell running for a 1-yard touchdown with a successful two-point conversion to make it 6-0 and then 14-0 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Browns finally got on the board as Cody Parkey made a 24-yard field goal to make the score 14-3. The Steelers however pulled away as Boswell kicked a 22-yard field goal making it 17-3. In the fourth quarter, the Browns drew closer as backup QB Josh McCown threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Gary Barnidge (with a failed PAT) to make the score 17-9. However, later on, the Steelers sealed the game when Javon Hargrave recovered a fumble in the end zone to make the final score 24-9. With their four-game losing streak coming to a stop, the Steelers improved to 5-5. Also, they move back into a tie on top of the AFC North due to the Ravens' loss to the Cowboys. The defense&#8212;which had only 13 sacks going into this game&#8212;managed to get eight in this game alone, as Cody Kessler and Josh McCown each got sacked four times.\nQuestion: How many points were scored in the first half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 14\n\nPassage: The Bengals flew to Invesco Field for a snowy Week 16 intraconference game with the Broncos. In the first quarter, Cincinnati scored first with running back Rudi Johnson's 6-yard touchdown run for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, Jay Cutler tied the game at seven, with a 1-yard TD pass to tight end Tony Scheffler. Cutler then handed Denver the lead with a 39-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Javon Walker. The Bengals cut the Bronco's lead with kicker Shayne Graham's 46-yard field goal, and quarterback Carson Palmer gave the Bengals the lead with an 11-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Chris Henry. In the second half, Denver pulled ahead with running back Mike Bell's 2-yard touchdown run, and kicker Jason Elam's 24-yard field goal.  Cincinnati would pull within one point with Palmer's 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh. On the extra point attempt, holder Kyle Larson allowed the snap to fly between his hands, securing the Broncos' win. The Bengal loss dropped their record to 8-7.\nQuestion: How many yards was the longest field goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 46-yard, \n\nPassage: In a rematch of a bitter 2005 loss for the Giants, when kicker Jay Feely missed three game-winning field goal attempts at the end of regulation and overtime in a 24-21 loss, the Seahawks made sure this game wouldn't be as close. After trading interceptions, with Corey Webster picking Matt Hasselbeck and Ken Hamlin intercepting Manning, the Seahawks jumped out to a quick 7-0 lead on a 2-yard touchdown run by Shaun Alexander. After forcing a punt, Hasselbeck tossed a 12-yard touchdown to Nate Burleson. Manning would be intercepted again by Hamlin on the ensuing drive, leading to a 4-yard touchdown pass from Hasselbeck to Darrell Jackson, and in eleven minutes, Seattle had a 21-0 lead. Manning had the ball on his own 43 with 10:43 left in the half when he threw his third pick of the game, this time to Michael Boulware. The Seahawks converted, going on a 12-play, 63-yard drive, capped off by a ten-yard touchdown pass from Hasselbeck to Will Heller. The game got worse for the Giants, as Plaxico Burress fumbled following a reception, with Leroy Hill recovering for Seattle. Hasselbeck then threw his fourth touchdown pass of the first half, this one going 21 yards to Bobby Engram. The Giants finally got on the board with a 46-yard field goal by Jay Feely as time expired. Seattle pushed the lead to 42-3 in the third quarter with a 17-play, 70-yard drive that ate up 9:58, capped by a 12-yard touchdown pass from Hasselbeck to Jackson. The Giants' offense, dormant all game, finally sprang to life in the fourth quarter. Manning found Amani Toomer on a 13-yard touchdown strike. After Fred Robbins intercepted Hasselbeck, Manning wasted no time finding Tim Carter on a 25-yard touchdown pass. When R.W. McQuarters intercepted Hasselbeck for a 27-yard touchdown return, the once-enormous Seattle lead was suddenly cut to 42-24, with 9:30 to play. The Giants would inch even closer after forcing a punt, and Manning found David Tyree on a 9-yard touchdown pass, cutting the lead down to 42-30. The two-point conversion failed, however, and Seattle recovered the ensuing onside kick with less than three minutes remaining, effectively ending the game.\nQuestion: How many touchdowns did Hasselbeck throw?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 4, \n\nPassage:  Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Patriots, the Raiders stayed at home for a Week 16 duel with the Houston Texans.  Oakland would get the early lead in the first quarter as quarterback JaMarcus Russell completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Chaz Schilens.  The Texans would respond with fullback Vonta Leach getting a 1-yard touchdown run, yet the Raiders would answer with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 33-yard and a 30-yard field goal.  Houston would tie the game in the second quarter with kicker Kris Brown getting a 53-yard and a 24-yard field goal. Oakland would take the lead in the third quarter with wide receiver Johnnie Lee Higgins catching a 29-yard touchdown pass from Russell, followed up by an 80-yard punt return for a touchdown.  The Texans tried to rally in the fourth quarter as Brown nailed a 40-yard field goal, yet the Raiders' defense would shut down any possible attempt.\nQuestion: How many yards difference is there between Kris Brown's longest and shortest field goals?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: The Eagles stayed home for a duel with their historic rival undefeated 6-0 Falcons.  Played under cloudy skies, the game was also notable in that the weather conditions heralded the approach of Hurricane Sandy, a storm set to make an unprecedented landfall in nearby New Jersey.  In the first quarter, the Falcons drew first blood as Matt Ryan found Drew Davis for a 15-yard pass to make the score 7-0.  The team increased their lead with Ryan finding Jason Snelling to make it 14-0.  In the 2nd quarter, the Eagles would get on the board with LeSean McCoy's 2-Yard run to make it 14-7.  However, the Falcons responded with Ryan's 63-yard TD pass to Julio Jones to make it 21-7.  The Falcon would increase their lead before halftime with Matt Bryant's 43-yard field goal to make it 24-7.  The Eagles would try to rally in the 3rd quarter with a 33-yard field goal from Alex Henry to shorten the lead to 24-10, but the Falcons pulled away as Bryant would kick a 29-yard field goal to make it 27-10.  In the 4th quarter, Bryant increased the Falcons' lead with a 30-yard field goal to make the score 30-10.  The Eagles tried to rally as Michael Vick found McCoy to make the score 30-17.

Portuguese sailors were at the vanguard of European overseas exploration, discovering and mapping the coasts of Africa, Canada, Asia and Brazil, in what became known as the Age of Discovery. Methodical expeditions started in 1419 along West Africa's coast under the sponsorship of prince Henry the Navigator, with Bartolomeu Dias reaching the Cape of Good Hope and entering the Indian Ocean in 1488. Ten years later, in 1498, Vasco da Gama led the first fleet around Africa to India, arriving in Calicut and starting a maritime route from Portugal to India. Portuguese explorations then proceeded to southeast Asia, where they reached Japan in 1542, forty-four years after their first arrival in India. In 1500, the Portuguese nobleman Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral became the first European to discover Brazil.\nQuestion: What kind of explorations?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Methodical expeditions, \n\nPassage: On 17 December 1297, the three brothers overthrew Kyawswa, and founded the Myinsaing Kingdom. At Pagan, Kyawswa's son Sawhnit was elected king by the dowager Queen Saw but soon became a governor under the authority of Myinsaing. Another of Kyawswa's sons, Kumara Kassapa, escaped to China. The Mongols did not know about the dethronement until June-July 1298. In 1300, the Myinsaing forces led by Athinkhaya attacked the Mongol garrisons north of Mandalay named Nga Singu and Male. On 22 June 1300, the Mongol Emperor declared that Kumara Kassapa was the rightful king of Burma, and sent in an army from Yunnan. The invasion force reached Myinsaing on 25 January 1301 but could not break through. The besiegers took the bribes by the three brothers, and withdrew on 6 April 1301. The Mongol government at Yunnan executed their commanders but sent no more invasions. They withdrew entirely from Upper Burma starting on 4 April 1303. By then, the city of Pagan, once home to 200,000 people, had been reduced to a small town, never to regain its preeminence.  The brothers placed one of Kyawswa's sons as the governor of Pagan. Anawrahta's line continued to rule Pagan as governors under Myinsaing, Pinya and Ava kingdoms until 1369. The male side of Pagan ended there although the female side passed into Pinya and Ava royalty. But the Pagan line continued to be claimed by successive Burmese dynasties down to the last Burmese dynasty Konbaung.\nQuestion: How many years after the Mongol army's withdrawal in Myinsaing did the Mongols withdraw entirely from Upper Burma?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2\n\nPassage:  Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Patriots, the Raiders stayed at home for a Week 16 duel with the Houston Texans.

                    "Passage: The Patriots travelled to the Metrodome for a Monday Night Football showdown with the Minnesota Vikings, who, like the Patriots, boasted an excellent run defense. The Patriots, who took to the air with a spread offense for the entire game, opened with a seven-play, 86-yard strike that ended with a touchdown pass from Brady to wide receiver Reche Caldwell. Their next drive was for 93 yards which resulted in a 23-yard Gostkowski field goal. And just before halftime the Patriots moved 74 yards in 11 plays to take a 17-0 lead on a nine-yard scoring toss to tight end Benjamin Watson. The only Vikings score of the game came on a 71-yard punt return by Mewelde Moore in the third quarter; Laurence Maroney immediately answered on the ensuing kickoff, with a 77-yard return to Minnesota's 21-yard line, his second return of over 70 yards in as many weeks. The Patriots' lead grew to 17 after a seven-yard touchdown reception by Brown with 9:03 in the third quarter and then became 31-7 with a touchdown catch by Jackson. The Patriots defense also intercepted four passes from quarterbacks Brad Johnson and Brooks Bollinger. On Bollinger's first drive after relieving Brad Johnson he was sacked three times in a row for a net loss of 23 yards. With their fourth straight victory, the Patriots advanced to 6-1.This was the Patriots' third and final game played in the Metrodome.\nQuestion: Which quarterback threw the most touchdown passes?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Brady, \n\nPassage: On 2 April, 2012, Mayor Jeffrey Lim of Salug, Zamboanga del Norte was kidnapped by ten armed men disguised as policemen.

                    "Passage: The Dallas Cowboys returned home to Texas Stadium to take on the 0-3 St. Louis Rams. Both teams remained scoreless in the 1st quarter. Also, starting cornerback Anthony Henry left with a sprained right ankle late in the first quarter. He'd return to the sidelines later in the game after x-rays were negative, but would not return to game. Early in the 2nd quarter, the Rams' Jeff Wilkins attempted a 28-yard field goal and missed. On the next possession, the Cowboys would cap an 80-yard drive down the field with a hand-off to Julius Jones for 2 yards and the first touchdown of the game. On the next Dallas possession, the Cowboys would punt after failing to convert on a 3rd down. Mat McBriar punt went 56 yards to the St. Louis 15 and Dante Hall returned it 86 yards for a Rams TD, tying the game. Late in the 2nd quarter, Tony Romo turned a bad snap from center Andre Gurode, 33-yards behind the line of scrimmage, into a 4-yard gain for a 3rd-down conversion. It kept the drive alive and enabled the Cowboys to regain the lead with 11 seconds left before halftime when Romo again ran with the ball for 15 yards and the second Cowboy touchdown of the game. In the second half, the Cowboys scored three more times as Romo connected twice with Patrick Crayton for 59- and 37-yard TDs, and with Jason Witten for a 17-yard TD. The Rams would get another chance to score, but QB Marc Bulger (playing with two broken ribs) would throw an interception in the end zone to Dallas' Ken Hamlin. Gus Frerotte would come in for Bulger in the 3rd quarter. The 35-7 victory marked the Cowboys' first 4-0 start since 1995, and left the Rams 0-4.\nQuestion: How many total yards were Patrick Crayton's touchdowns?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 96\n\nPassage: The only field army remaining to the King was Goring's, and though Hopton, who sorrowfully accepted the command after Goring's departure, tried at the last moment to revive the memories and the local patriotism of 1643, it was of no use to fight against the New Model with the armed rabble that Goring turned over to him. Dartmouth surrendered on 18 January 1646, Hopton was defeated at the Battle of Torrington on 16 February, and surrendered the remnant of his worthless army on 14 March. Exeter fell on 13 April. Elsewhere, Hereford was taken on 17 December 1645, and the Battle of Stow-on-the-Wold, the last pitched battle of the war, was fought and lost by Lord Astley on 21 March 1646. On 27 April Charles I journeyed from Oxford to Newark and surrendered on 5 May to General David Leslie, commander of the Scottish army besiege Newark. Newark surrendered the next day and the third siege of Oxford ended with a treaty being negotiated by Sir Richard Lane and signed on 24 June. Wallingford Castle, the last English royalist stronghold, fell after a 65-day siege on 27 July. On 31 August Montrose escaped from the Highlands. On the 19th of the same month Raglan Castle surrendered, and the last Royalist post of all, Harlech Castle, maintained the useless struggle until 13 March 1647. Charles himself, after leaving Newark in November 1645, had spent the winter in and around Oxford, whence, after an adventurous journey, he came to the camp of the Scottish army at Southwell on 5 May 1646.\nQuestion: How many days passed between Dartmouth's surrender and the defeat of Hopton at the Battle of Torrington?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 29, \n\nPassage:  Carolina had a rough start in the first half, only scoring seven points, and went into halftime seventeen points behind Oakland. They turned things around and had an explosive third quarter scoring eighteen points giving them a one-point lead over the Raiders. In the fourth quarter the Panthers went on to score seven but the Raiders answered back tying the game. In their last possession of the game the ball was taken from Cam Newton giving Oakland the ball back. Carolina could not hold on as Oakland kicked a field goal winning the game. They fall to 4-7.\nQuestion: How many more losses than wins did Carolina have after this game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3\n\nPassage:  Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Patriots, the Raiders stayed at home for a Week 16 duel with the Houston Texans.  Oakland would get the early lead in the first quarter as quarterback JaMarcus Russell completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Chaz Schilens.  The Texans would respond with fullback Vonta Leach getting a 1-yard touchdown run, yet the Raiders would answer with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 33-yard and a 30-yard field goal.  Houston would tie the game in the second quarter with kicker Kris Brown getting a 53-yard and a 24-yard field goal. Oakland would take the lead in the third quarter with wide receiver Johnnie Lee Higgins catching a 29-yard touchdown pass from Russell, followed up by an 80-yard punt return for a touchdown.  The Texans tried to rally in the fourth quarter as Brown nailed a 40-yard field goal, yet the Raiders' defense would shut down any possible attempt.\nQuestion: How many yards was the longest passing touchdown?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: In the 14th installment of the Brady-Manning Rivalry, the Patriots and Broncos battled in one of the most exciting editions of NBC Sunday Night Football in recent memory. The expected shootout between two potent offenses did not occur at the start of the game, as three New England turnovers on their first three drives of the game gave the Broncos a 17-0 lead in the 1st quarter. It was looking to be one of the most embarrassing performances in Patriot history as an additional touchdown gave Manning and the Broncos a 24-0 at the half. However, Brady and the Patriots were not going to let the Broncos run away with a blowout victory at Gillette. They regrouped in the locker room and came out to score 31 unanswered points, scoring on five straight drives out of the half, helped by three Denver turnovers of their own. The two halves were complete polar opposites, each displaying offensive domination on one side and defensive struggles on the other, flipping 180&#730; at the half. However, the Broncos managed to tie the game at 31 late in the 4th, eventually sending the game to overtime. The Patriots won the coin toss, but surprisingly elected to defend first, hoping to stop the Broncos from scoring and to take advantage of the wind for a potential game-winning field goal. This was exactly what happened, as the two teams traded punts twice, but on New England's second punt, Broncos cornerback Tony Carter ran into the punt, and Patriots' Nate Ebner recovered the ball on the Broncos' 20 yard line, setting up Gostkowski's game winning 31 yard field goal. The 24 point deficit was the largest comeback in Brady's and the Patriots' history, and gave Brady his 10th win in 14 meetings over Manning-led teams. Brady threw for 344 yard and 3 TD's in the contest, and WR Julian Edelman had a career day with 110 receiving yards for two scores. The win from down 24 points was the largest comeback win in Patriots history, surpassing 1984's comeback from down 23-0 against the Seahawks.  The Patriots would break this comeback record three years later in Super Bowl LI.\nQuestion: How many combined turnovers did the teams have?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 6, \n\nPassage: Following their season sweep over the Raiders, the Broncos went home for a Sunday Night match-up with their AFC West rival, the San Diego Chargers.  With first place in the division on the line, both sides would play tough.  In the first quarter, the Chargers got the only score of the period as LaDainian Tomlinson scored on a 3-yard TD run on a 98-yard drive.  In the second quarter, the Broncos took the lead with RB Mike Bell getting two 3-yard TD runs.  In the third quarter, kicker Jason Elam completed a 42-yard field goal, while CB Darrent Williams returned an interception 31 yards for a touchdown. However, things started getting grim as Tomlinson (who historically had difficulty against the Broncos in Denver) exploded with a 3-yard TD run and a 51-yard touchdown reception.  In the fourth quarter, Elam would get a 38-yard field goal, but San Diego managed to wrap up the game with QB Philip Rivers completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson and Tomlinson getting a 1-yard TD run.  With the loss, the Broncos fell to 7-3 and second place in the AFC West. It would later be learned that safety Nick Ferguson had season-ending surgery to repair a torn medial meniscus in his left knee. He injured his knee after a 1st quarter interception.\nQuestion: Which player scored the last points of the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Tomlinson, \n\nPassage: There were a total of 70,331 births in Colorado in 2006. (Birth rate of 14.6 per thousand.) In 2007, non-Hispanic whites were involved in 59.1% of all the births. Some 14.06% of those births involved a non-Hispanic white person and someone of a different race, most often with a couple including one Hispanic. A birth where at least one Hispanic person was involved counted for 43% of the births in Colorado. As of the 2010 United States Census, Colorado has the seventh highest percentage of Hispanics (20.7%) in the U.S. behind New Mexico (46.3%), California (37.6%), Texas (37.6%), Arizona (29.6%), Nevada (26.5%), and Florida (22.5%). Per the 2000 census, the Hispanic population is estimated to be 918,899 or approximately 20% of the state total population. Colorado has the 5th-largest population of Mexican-Americans, behind California, Texas, Arizona, and Illinois. In percentages, Colorado has the 6th-highest percentage of Mexican-Americans, behind New Mexico, California, Texas, Arizona, and Nevada.\nQuestion: How many percent of births were not with non-Hispanic white and someone of a different race?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 85.94\n\nPassage:  Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Patriots, the Raiders stayed at home for a Week 16 duel with the Houston Texans.

He was the son of Stephen VIII B\u00e1thory  of the noble Hungarian B\u00e1thory family and his wife Catherine Telegdi. He had at least five siblings: two brothers and three sisters. Little is known about his childhood. Around 1549-1550 he briefly visited Italy and probably spent a few months attending lectures at the Padua University. Upon his return, he joined the army of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, and took part in his military struggle against the Turks. Some time after 1553 B\u00e1thory was captured by the Turks, and after Ferdinand I refused to pay his ransom, joined the opposing side, supporting John II Sigismund Z\u00e1polya in his struggle for power in the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. As Z\u00e1polya's supporter, B\u00e1thory acted both as a feudal lord, military commander and a diplomat. During one of his trips to Vienna he was put under house arrest for two years. During this time he fell out of favour at Z\u00e1polya's court, and his position was largely assumed by another Hungarian noble, G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Bekes. B\u00e1thory briefly retired from politics, but he still wielded considerable influence and was seen as a possible successor to Z\u00e1polya. After Z\u00e1polya's death in 1571, the Transylvanian estates elected B\u00e1thory Voivode of Transylvania. Bekes, supported by the Habsburgs, disputed his election, but by 1573 B\u00e1thory emerged victorious in the resulting civil war and drove Bekes out of Transylvania. He subsequently attempted to play the Ottomans and the Holy Roman Empire against one another in an attempt to strengthen the Transylvania position.\nQuestion: What happened first, Z\u00e1polya's death or B\u00e1thory's visit to Italy?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Italy, \n\nPassage: Coming off their divisional home win over the Jets, the Bills stayed at home, donned their throwback uniforms, and played their first home Monday Night football game in 13 years against the undefeated Dallas Cowboys.  In the first quarter, Buffalo got off to a fast start with DB George Wilson returning an interception 25-yard for a touchdown, along with the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Cowboys tied the game with QB Tony Romo completing a 22-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten.  Afterwards, Buffalo increased its lead with kicker Rian Lindell getting a 24-yard field goal, along with DE Chris Kelsay intercepting a Romo pass in the endzone for a touchdown.  Dallas would end the half with kicker Nick Folk getting a 47-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Dallas drew closer with Folk kicking a 29-yard field goal.  Fortunately, the Bills immediately responded with CB Terrence McGee returning a kickoff 102 yards for a touchdown.  The Bills led 24-13 until 3:46 left in the fourth quarter, when the Cowboys got within 8 points with Folk getting a 37-yard field goal.  From there, things began to look grim for Buffalo as a Trent Edwards interception eventually turned into Romo's 4-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton. The two-point conversion was no good, but Dallas got a successful onside kick.  With only 3 seconds left, Folk came out for a 53-yard field goal.  The first try was good, yet it was negated with Head Coach Dick Jauron calling time out (repeating a move done by both the Denver Broncos in week 2 and the Oakland Raiders in week 3).  However, the technique that worked for Denver and Oakland for this year failed as Folk got the game-winning 53-yard field goal as time ran out, despite the Bills defense getting 6 turnovers from Romo (5 interceptions and 1 fumble). With the heart-breaking loss, the Bills entered their bye week at 1-4.\nQuestion: Who scored the most field goals?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Nick Folk, \n\nPassage:  Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Patriots, the Raiders stayed at home for a Week 16 duel with the Houston Texans.  Oakland would get the early lead in the first quarter as quarterback JaMarcus Russell completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Chaz Schilens.  The Texans would respond with fullback Vonta Leach getting a 1-yard touchdown run, yet the Raiders would answer with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 33-yard and a 30-yard field goal.  Houston would tie the game in the second quarter with kicker Kris Brown getting a 53-yard and a 24-yard field goal. Oakland would take the lead in the third quarter with wide receiver Johnnie Lee Higgins catching a 29-yard touchdown pass from Russell, followed up by an 80-yard punt return for a touchdown.  The Texans tried to rally in the fourth quarter as Brown nailed a 40-yard field goal, yet the Raiders' defense would shut down any possible attempt.\nQuestion: How many field goals were scored in the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: With the tribes to the north and west destroyed, the Iroquois turned their attention southward to the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock. 1660 marked the zenith of Iroquois military power, and they were able to use that to their advantage in the decades to follow. The Susquehannock had become allied with the English in the Maryland colony in 1661. The English had grown fearful of the Iroquois and hoped an alliance with Susquehannock would help block the northern tribes' advance on the English colonies. In 1663 the Iroquois sent an army of 800 warriors into the Susquehannock territory. They repulsed the army, but the invasion prompted the colony of Maryland to declare war on the Iroquois. By supplying Susquehannock forts with artillery, the English in Maryland changed the balance of power away from the Iroquois. The Susquehannock took the upper hand and began to invade Iroquois territory, where they caused significant damage. This warfare continued intermittently for 11 years. In 1674 the English in Maryland changed their Indian Policy and negotiated peace with the Iroquois. They terminated their alliance with the Susquehannock. In 1675 the militias of Virginia and Maryland captured and executed the chiefs of the Susquehannock, whose growing power they feared. The Iroquois made quick work of the rest of the nation. They drove the warriors from traditional territory and absorbed the survivors in 1677. During the course of this conflict, in 1670 the Iroquois also drove the Siouan-speaking Mannahoac tribe out of the northern Virginia Piedmont region. The Iroquois claimed the land by right of conquest as a hunting ground. The English acknowledged this claim in 1674 and again in 1684. They acquired the land from the Iroquois by a 1722 treaty.\nQuestion: Which happenend first, the zenith of Iroquois military power, or the colony of Maryland delaring war on the Iroquois?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: zenith of Iroquois military power, \n\nPassage: After the week 12 win over the Cleveland Browns, the Bengals stayed home for a game against the Detroit Lions. The first and only score of the first quarter for both teams came when the Lions' Calvin Johnson caught a 54-yard pass from Matthew Stafford for a touchdown, which made the Lions lead 7-0 at the end of the first quarter. In the second quarter, with 11:50 left, Jonathan Fanene got a 45-yard interception pass for a touchdown, which tied the game 7-7. Later in the 2nd quarter, with 5:50 left, Chad Ochocinco caught a 36-yard pass from Carson Palmer for a touchdown, which made the Bengals lead by 7. In celebration, he donned a poncho and sombrero, for which the NFL handed him another $20,000 fine. A 44-yard field goal by Shayne Graham with 0:09 left in the half made the halftime score 17-7. A 39-yard field goal by Shayne Graham was the only score for both teams in the 3rd quarter. With 8:11 left in the 4th quarter, Shayne Graham kicked a 23-yard field goal, to make the score 23-7. The Lions later had a 2-yard touchdown run by Kevin Smith with 1:36 left in the game. The Lions then attempted a 2-point conversion, but failed, making the final score 23-13. With the win, the Bengals improved to 9-3 and secured only their third winning season in nineteen years .\nQuestion: How many total yards did Graham have?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 106\n\nPassage: As of the 2015 5-year ACS, the median income for a household in the county was $51,968, and the median income for a family was $61,809.

                    "Passage: DeMarco Murray's 115 yard rushing day against the Seahawks, made him only the second running back in NFL history - next to Jim Brown - to rush for 100 yards in the first 6 games of the season. Jim Brown did it for the first six games of the 1958 season. With the victory, the Cowboys improved to 5-1 on the season, their best record since the 2007 campaign. Dallas became the first team outside the NFC West to win in Seattle since 2011. Five days after Seattle's loss at home to the Cowboys, the Seahawks traded WR Percy Harvin to the New York Jets for an undisclosed draft selection. It was reported that the surprisingly sudden move by Seattle was due in large part to Harvin refusing to return to the game in the fourth quarter. While Percy Harvin had a 46-yard kickoff return, Harvin's total yardage for rushing and receiving was -1 yard against the Cowboys. Dan Bailey's 3rd quarter 42-yard field goal made him 100-for-110 on field goals for his career, making him the most accurate kicker in NFL history with a FG percentage of 90.826% from 2011-2014. Mike Vanderjagt is second in all-time NFL accuracy with a FG percentage of 86.466% from 1998-2006. Stephen Gostkowski is a close third in NFL accuracy with a FG percentage of 86.328% from 2006-2014.\nQuestion: How many wins did the Cowboys have after the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 5\n\nPassage: Newfoundland's coast was dotted with small French and English communities, with some fishing stations occupied seasonally by fishermen from Europe. Both sides had fortified their principal towns, the French at Plaisance on the western side of the Avalon Peninsula, the English at St. John's on Conception Bay. During King William's War, d'Iberville had destroyed most of the English communities in 1696-97, and the island again became a battleground in 1702. In August of that year, an English fleet under the command of Commodore John Leake descended on the outlying French communities but made no attempts on Plaisance. During the winter of 1705, Plaisance's French governor Daniel d'Auger de Subercase retaliated, leading a combined French and Mi'kmaq expedition that destroyed several English settlements and unsuccessfully besieged Fort William at St. John's. The French and their Indian allies continued to harry the English throughout the summer and did damages to the English establishments claimed at \u00a3188,000. The English sent a fleet in 1706 that destroyed French fishing outposts on the island's northern coasts. In December 1708, a combined force of French, Canadian, and Mi'kmaq volunteers captured St. John's and destroyed the fortifications. They lacked the resources to hold the prize, however, so they abandoned it, and St. John's was reoccupied and refortified by the English in 1709. English fleet commanders contemplated attacks on Plaisance in 1703 and 1711 but did not make them, the latter by Admiral Walker in the aftermath of the disaster at the mouth of the St. Lawrence.\nQuestion: How many years apart were the times where English fleet commanders contemplated attacks on Plaisance but did not make them?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 8\n\nPassage: Coming off their bye week the Rams flew to Candlestick Park for an NFC West rivalry match against the 49ers. In the first quarter the Rams took the lead with kicker Josh Brown making a 42-yard field goal. They trailed with RB Frank Gore getting a 1-yard TD run. This was followed in the second quarter by kicker Joe Nedney nailing a 26-yard field goal. The Rams fought back and took the lead with QB Sam Bradford completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR Danny Amendola. Followed in the third quarter by RB Steven Jackson getting a 13-yard TD run. The 49ers got the lead back with Nedney getting a 47-yard field goal, followed by QB Troy Smith making a 16-yard TD pass to WR Michael Crabtree. Te Rams tied the game with Brown making a 33-yard field goal. The decision was made at overtime when Nedney successfully put away a 29-yard field goal to give the Rams a loss, bringing their record down to 4-5.\nQuestion: How many yards was the 49ers' final field goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 29, \n\nPassage:  Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Patriots, the Raiders stayed at home for a Week 16 duel with the Houston Texans.

Of the total households, 59.3% were family households, with 28.2% of these including the familys own children under the age of 18; 36.5% were husband-wife families; 17.2% had a female householder (with no husband present) and 5.6% had a male householder (with no wife present). The remaining 40.7% were non-family households. , 32% of the non-family households included individuals living alone, 8.3% of these households included individuals age 65 years of age or older.\nQuestion: Which group from the census is smaller: family households or non-family households?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: non-family households, \n\nPassage: Rajasinghe II, the king of Kandy, made a treaty with the Dutch in 1638 to get rid of the Portuguese who ruled most of the coastal areas of the island. The main conditions of the treaty were that the Dutch were to hand over the coastal areas they had captured to the Kandyan king in return for a Dutch trade monopoly over the island. The agreement was breached by both parties. The Dutch captured Colombo in 1656 and the last Portuguese strongholds near Jaffnapatnam in 1658. By 1660 they controlled the whole island except the land-locked kingdom of Kandy. The Dutch  persecuted the Catholics and the remaining Portuguese settlers but left Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims alone. The Dutch levied far heavier taxes on the people than the Portuguese had done. A legacy of the Dutch period in Ceylon are the Dutch Burghers, a people of mixed Dutch and local origin. A later definition of the Burgher people of Ceylon was handed down in 1883 by the Chief Justice of Ceylon, Sir Richard Ottley.\nQuestion: How many years was it from when the Dutch captured Columbo and when a later definition of the Burgher  peopel of Ceylon was handed down?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 227, \n\nPassage: The Rams traveled to Glendale, Arizona for their first game in the new Cardinals Stadium. With 11:28 left in the first quarter of play, Matt Turk kicked a 31-yard punt giving the Cardinals the ball on the Saint Louis 45. Nine plays later, Kurt Warner threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Larry Fitzgerald. This gave the Cardinals a 7-0 lead with 7:04 left in the quarter. With 11:28 left in the second quarter, Jeff Wilkins hit a 26-yard field goal to put the Rams on the board 7-3. On the Cardinals next drive, Warner was intercepted by O.J. Atogwe giving the Rams the ball on their own 6-yard line. Marc Bulger hit Torry Holt for gains of 42, 26 and 9 yards during the drive, with the final catch ending in a touchdown. It was the second touchdown for Holt and the Rams for the 2006 season. The very first play of the next Cardinals drive, Warner was intercepted again by Fakhir Brown. The Rams drove the ball down the field for 16 yards setting up a Wilkins 47-yard field goal to end the half, giving the Rams a 13-7 lead. Wilkins kicked another field goal with 8:08 left in the third quarter increasing the Rams lead 16-7. With 4:13 left in the fourth quarter, the Cardinals ended a 16-play, 87-yard drive with a 9-yard Edgerrin James run for a touchdown cutting the Rams lead 16-14. With 1:58 left to play, Bulger fumbled the ball at the Saint Louis 30. It was recovered by Arizona's Antonio Smith. Yet, on the third play of the drive, Warner fumbled the snap and the Rams' Will Witherspoon recovered the ball. The Rams ran the clock out and won the game 16-14. Rookie Victor Adeyanju got his first start in the game, replacing Anthony Hargrove who did not show up for meetings and practices.

                    "Passage: The Browns remained at home for their Week 2 game with their interstate rivals, the Cincinnati Bengals. Coming into the game, the Bengals held a one-game advantage over the Browns in the all-time series, 34-33 . However, the Browns defeated the Bengals in a high-scoring contest, 51-45, which saw 12 offensive touchdowns - and tied the overall series between the two teams at 34 wins each. The game opened with a 13-yard touchdown pass from Carson Palmer to running back Rudi Johnson - the first receiving touchdown of his career. After a Cleveland punt, safety Sean Jones intercepted a Palmer pass intended for Chad Johnson, which gave the Browns possession. However, they were unable to score a touchdown, and scored with a 39-yard Phil Dawson field goal instead. After a Bengals punt, Dawson kicked another 39-yard field goal before the end of the quarter. The Bengals began the second quarter with Rudi Johnson fumbling the football, which was recovered by cornerback Leigh Bodden. Derek Anderson, starting after the team's trade of Charlie Frye during the week, completed a pass to Joe Jurevicius in the back of the endzone for a 17-yard touchdown, putting the Browns ahead 13-7. The Bengals countered with another touchdown pass, this time a 23-yard pass to T. J. Houshmandzadeh. Browns head coach Romeo Crennel challenged the ruling on the field that the receiver was in bounds on the catch, but the officials upheld the call. On the ensuing kickoff, Josh Cribbs returned the ball 88&#160;yards to the Bengals' 11-yard line. The drive was capped off with a 9-yard pass from Anderson to Jurevicius, giving him his second touchdown reception of the game and putting the Browns ahead 20-14. The Bengals answered the Browns' touchdown pass with another score of their own, this time a 22-yard pass to Chad Johnson. Johnson was wide open in the endzone, uncovered because Bodden had slipped. After his catch, Johnson attempted to find the Browns' Dawg Pound so he could jump into it and keep his pregame promise to do so if he scored. He was unable to do so, though, since he had scored in the end zone opposite the Dawg Pound. Following the Bengals' score, the Browns answered with a 97-yard kickoff return to Cincinnati's four-yard line by Cribbs; however, due to several penalties on the play, it was called back. Though the team was penalized, Anderson eventually threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Kellen Winslow II to give the Browns a 27-21 lead at halftime. The Bengals began the third quarter with a Dexter Jackson interception of Anderson, and the team gained ground on the Browns with a 20-yard Shayne Graham field goal. On the Browns' next drive, Anderson hooked up with Braylon Edwards for a 34-yard touchdown pass, allowing the Browns to increase their lead to ten points again, 34-24. However, just as in the first half, the Bengals answered the Browns' score with a score of their own, a 14-yard touchdown pass to Chad Johnson. Carrying out his promise, Johnson leaped into the Dawg Pound, where a fan poured beer onto him. With the Bengals only trailing by three points, running back Jamal Lewis exploded out of the backfield and ran 66&#160;yards for a touchdown to increase the Browns' lead back to ten points. Five minutes later, on the next drive, Carson Palmer hit T. J. Houshmandzadeh, this time a 5-yard touchdown pass, to bring the Browns' lead back to three. The Browns' next drive was cut short on a fourth-and-short rushing attempt by fullback Lawrence Vickers; however, the Bengals were forced to punt on their next drive, and managed to down the ball inside the Browns' ten-yard line. The Browns answered the Bengals' third-quarter touchdown with a 37-yard pass from Anderson to Edwards, again increasing the lead to ten points, 48-38. After another punt by the Bengals, Phil Dawson kicked his third field goal of the game, from 18&#160;yards, to give the Browns a 13-point lead. With time running down, Palmer led his team to yet another score, this time on a 7-yard pass to Glenn Holt, to cut the Browns' lead to six points. However, this would be the final scoring drive of the game; the Browns punted on their next possession, which was followed by a Leigh Bodden interception of a Palmer pass in Browns territory as Palmer was attempting to lead his team on a quick scoring drive. The play was reviewed by officials but upheld, allowing Derek Anderson to take a knee to run the clock out and win his first game as a starting quarterback. Browns' quarterback Derek Anderson tied a franchise record with five touchdown passes in the game. Running back Jamal Lewis also became the first Browns running back in more than 20 years, rushing for 215&#160;yards on 22 carries and scoring a touchdown. Wide receiver Braylon Edwards and tight end Kellen Winslow also added more than 100&#160;yards receiving each: Edwards had eight receptions for 146&#160;yards with two touchdowns, and Winslow had six catches for 100&#160;yards and a touchdown. The teams' combined score at the end of the game was 96 points; the teams together scored 106 points in a game in 2004. The rivals now own two of the top scoring games in the history of the league. Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer also set a franchise record with his six touchdown passes, while wide receiver Chad Johnson became the franchise's all-time leader in receiving yards. It was only the third time in NFL history that two quarterbacks had thrown at least five touchdown passes in the same game. For his performance against the Bengals, quarterback Derek Anderson was named the AFC Player of the Week. Anderson was 20-for-33 passing with five touchdowns and one interception for a passer rating of 121.0.\nQuestion: Which player had the most rushing yards?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Jamal Lewis\n\nPassage: The Browns traveled to London but were considered home team against the Vikings.  They scored first in the first quarter when Isaiah Crowell ran for a 26-yard touchdown (with a failed PAT) to make it 6-0.  The Vikes got on the board when Kai Forbath kicked a 35-yard field goal to make it 6-3.  The Vikes took the lead when Case Keenum found Adam Thielen on an 18-yard pass (with a failed PAT) to make it 9-3.  DeShone Kizer ran for a 1-yard touchdown to put the Browns back in the lead 13-9.  Though, the Vikes soon followed when Forbath kicked a 34-yard field goal to make it 13-12 at halftime.  In the third quarter, the Vikes retook the lead after Forbath kicked a 43-yard field goal to make it 15-13.  Zane Gonzalez then put up a 23-yard field goal to make it 16-15 in favor of the Browns retaking the lead.  Though it wouldn't last long when the Vikes retook the lead later on in the quarter when Jerick McKinnon ran for a 1-yard touchdown (with a successful 2-point conversion) to make it 23-16.  In the fourth quarter, the Vikes sealed the game when Keenum found Kyle Rudolph on a 4-yard pass to make it 30-16.  Then Forbath kicked a 51-yard field goal to make the final score 33-16. With the loss, the Browns went into their bye week 0-8. It was the 3rd time in franchise history that the Browns failed to win a regular season game in the 1st half of a season (1975, 2016).  Their 8th loss ensured that the team would fail to finish a season with a winning record for the 10th consecutive year, extending a franchise record.\nQuestion: How many points were scored in the second half of the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 24, \n\nPassage: France in the Ancien R\u00e9gime covered a territory of around 200,000 square miles , and supported 22 million people in 1700. At least 96% of the population were peasants. France had the largest population in Europe, with European Russia second at 20 million. Britain had nearly six million, Spain had eight million, and the Austrian Habsburgs had around eight million. Russia was the most populated European country at the time. France's lead slowly faded after 1700, as other countries grew faster.\nQuestion: What two country have about the same population?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Spain had eight million, and the Austrian Habsburgs had around eight million., \n\nPassage:  Still searching for their first win, the Bengals flew to Texas Stadium for a Week 5 interconference duel with the Dallas Cowboys.

                    "Passage: After their win against the Baltimore Ravens 19-17, the Packers, wearing their throwback jerseys of blue and yellow, returned home to Lambeau Field to take on the Cleveland Browns. Both James Jones and Randall Cobb would be inactive for the game, and Jarrett Boykin got his first career start. He had a breakout game, catching 8 passes for 103 yards and 1 TD. After forcing the Browns to punt on their opening possession, the Packers quickly struck with a 10-yard TD pass to Jermichael Finley. After Brandon Weeden's pass was intercepted by Davon House on the next drive, the Packers took advantage with a 1-yard TD run by Eddie Lacy to take a 14-0 lead in the 1st quarter. After Cleveland scored on a 46-yard field goal, the Packers responded with a 26-yard field goal to take a 17-3 lead at halftime. In the 3rd quarter, the Browns scored on a 44-yard field goal to make it 17-6. Early in the 4th quarter, the Browns decided to go for it on 4th down and 15 on the Packers 31-yard line. The pass to Jordan Cameron in the endzone was incomplete, and the Packers took over. On the drive, Jermichael Finley was carried off the field on a stretcher after suffering a neck injury. The Packers capped off that drive with a 1-yard TD pass to Jordy Nelson. They followed it up with a 20-yard TD pass to Jarrett Boykin, taking a 31-13 win. About two weeks after the game, Jermichael Finley was put on IR. With the win, the Packers extend their winning streak to 3, and improve to 4-2.\nQuestion: How many points did the Packers win by?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 18, \n\nPassage: The Bengals returned home to take on the Seahawks.  They would score first in the first quarter when Andy Dalton found Tyler Eifert on a 14-yard TD pass for a 7-0.  The Seahawks scored 24 straight points: later on in the quarter they managed to tie it up when Russel Wilson found Jermaine Kearse on a 30-yard TD pass for a 7-7 game.In the second quarter, the Seahawks took the lead as Steven Hauschka nailed a 24-yard field goal for a 10-7 game at halftime.  In the third quarter, the Seahawks went back to work as Thomas Rawls ran for a 69-yard TD for a 17-7 game followed up by Bobby Wagner returning a fumble 23 yards for a TD for a 24-7 game.  In the fourth quarter, the Bengals would start a reign of 20 straight points:  First starting out when Dalton and Eifert hooked up again on a 10-yard TD pass for a 24-14 game followed by Dalton running for a 5-yard TD for a 24-21 game.  Mike Nugent then kicked a 31-yard field goal through for a tied game at 24-24.  In overtime, Nugent would kick the game winning 42-yard field goal for the 27-24 win. With the win, the Bengals improved to 5-0 for the first time since 1988. This win also tied the 3rd largest comeback win in franchise history. It was also the first time the Seahawks had blown a 17-point 4th quarter lead since 2004 against St. Louis.\nQuestion: How many yards was the longest field goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 42\n\nPassage: Albania is a secular state without an official religion, with the freedom of religion being a Constitution of Albania right.

                    "Passage: With the tribes to the north and west destroyed, the Iroquois turned their attention southward to the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock. 1660 marked the zenith of Iroquois military power, and they were able to use that to their advantage in the decades to follow. The Susquehannock had become allied with the English in the Maryland colony in 1661. The English had grown fearful of the Iroquois and hoped an alliance with Susquehannock would help block the northern tribes' advance on the English colonies. In 1663 the Iroquois sent an army of 800 warriors into the Susquehannock territory. They repulsed the army, but the invasion prompted the colony of Maryland to declare war on the Iroquois. By supplying Susquehannock forts with artillery, the English in Maryland changed the balance of power away from the Iroquois. The Susquehannock took the upper hand and began to invade Iroquois territory, where they caused significant damage. This warfare continued intermittently for 11 years. In 1674 the English in Maryland changed their Indian Policy and negotiated peace with the Iroquois. They terminated their alliance with the Susquehannock. In 1675 the militias of Virginia and Maryland captured and executed the chiefs of the Susquehannock, whose growing power they feared. The Iroquois made quick work of the rest of the nation. They drove the warriors from traditional territory and absorbed the survivors in 1677. During the course of this conflict, in 1670 the Iroquois also drove the Siouan-speaking Mannahoac tribe out of the northern Virginia Piedmont region. The Iroquois claimed the land by right of conquest as a hunting ground. The English acknowledged this claim in 1674 and again in 1684. They acquired the land from the Iroquois by a 1722 treaty.\nQuestion: How many years after the Iroquois military power reached its zenith, did the English negotiate peace with the Iroquois?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 14\n\nPassage: Still searching for their first win of the year, the Dolphins returned home for a Week 7 AFC East duel with the undefeated New England Patriots.  In the first quarter, Miami's struggles continued as Patriots QB Tom Brady completed a 30-yard TD pass to WR Dont&#233; Stallworth and a 2-yard TD pass to TE Kyle Brady.  In the second quarter, the Dolphins got their only score of the half with QB Cleo Lemon getting a 4-yard TD run.  Afterwards, New England continued its pounding with CB Willie Andrews returning a kickoff 77 yards for a touchdown, along with Brady and WR Randy Moss hooking up with each other on a 35-yard and a 50-yard TD pass.  The Patriots would end the half with Brady hooking up with WR Wes Welker on a 14-yard TD pass. After a scoreless third quarter, Miami tried to make a comeback in the fourth quarter.  It began with RB Patrick Cobbs getting a 1-yard TD run, along with DE Jason Taylor returning an interception 36 yards for a touchdown.  However, New England made sure that they sealed their victory with Brady hooking up with Welker again on a 16-yard TD pass.  Afterwards, the 'Fins ended the game with RB Jesse Chatman getting a 7-yard TD run. With the loss, not only did the Dolphins fall to 0-7 for the first time in franchise history, but they also lost RB Ronnie Brown for the year, as he tore his ACL in the third quarter while trying to stop an interception return.\nQuestion: Who threw the first touchdown pass of the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Tom Brady\n\nPassage: The Giants and Bucs were confronted with winds greater than 40&#160;mph at the Meadowlands, but the Giants' defense dominated early and often.  The Giants were able to hold the Bucs to six three and outs in their first seven possessions.  On offense, Eli Manning and Tiki Barber were effective if not spectacular.  Near the end of the first quarter, the Giants started a 54-yard drive, culminating on a seven-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Plaxico Burress. Midway through the second quarter, the defense struck again as Cadillac Williams fumbled a pitch and tackle Fred Robbins recovered for New York at the Bucs' 28.  The Giants then used a deep pass to Burress and hard-nosed running to extend their lead to 14-0.  The touchdown was scored on a one yard plunge by Brandon Jacobs.  Tampa Bay had chances to get back into the game over the next 20 minutes, but several dropped passes and questionable fourth down plays doomed them.  Overall, rookie quarterback Bruce Gradkowski played well for Tampa Bay, but it wasn't enough.  The Giants clinched the win late in the fourth quarter with some power running from Jacobs and Barber.  Jay Feely added a 31-yard field goal to provide the final points in the 17-3 win. Rookie defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka had his first ever sack and six tackles, middle linebacker Reggie Torbor added a sack, and Fred Robbins continued his fine season with the fumble recovery.  On offense, Barber and Jacobs rushed for over 100 yards combined, Burress notched seven receptions,  and Manning completed 16 of 31 passes for 154 yards and the touchdown to Burress.  The key was his ability to avoid the mistakes in the blustery conditions. Note: The two offensive touchdowns scored by the Giants in this game were the first two offensive touchdowns scored against the Bucs since Tiki and Ronde Barber met for the first time during the 1997 season.\nQuestion: How many more points did the Giants win by?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 14, \n\nPassage:  Still searching for their first win, the Bengals flew to Texas Stadium for a Week 5 interconference duel with the Dallas Cowboys.

                    "Passage: Philip IV of France became King in 1285, and was determined to strengthen the French monarchy at any cost. The County of Flanders had been formally part of the French Kingdom since the Treaty of Verdun in 843, but had always de facto been largely, if not fully, independent from the French crown. Flanders had some of the richest cities of that time, like Bruges, Ghent, Ypres, Lille and Douai. These cities tried to keep their independence from the Count of Flanders and from the rural aristocracy. But the cities were themselves divided between the rich patricians and the urban tradesmen, united in guilds. In 1288, Philip IV of France used complaints over taxes to tighten his control over Flanders. Tension built between Guy of Dampierre, Count of Flanders and the King. In 1294, Guy turned for help to King Edward I of England, arranging a marriage between his daughter Philippa and Edward, Prince of Wales. However, Philip imprisoned Guy and two of his sons, forced him to call off the marriage, and imprisoned Philippa in Paris until her death in 1306. Guy was summoned before the king again in 1296, and the principal cities of Flanders were taken under royal protection, until Guy paid an indemnity and surrendered his territories, to hold them at the grace of the King. After these indignities, in 1297 Guy attempted to revenge himself on Philip by an alliance with Edward I of England, now at war with France. Philip responded by declaring Flanders annexed to the royal domain and sending a French army under Robert II of Artois to conquer Flanders.\nQuestion: How many years after he first attempted to ally with Edward I did Guy attempt another alliance with Edward I of England?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3, \n\nPassage: This overall downturn affected Holdens profits; the company recorded a combined gain of A$842.9 million from 2002 to 2004, and a combined loss of A$290 million from 2005 to 2006. Factors contributing to the loss included the development of an all-new model, the strong Australian dollar and the cost of reducing the workforce at the Elizabeth plant, including the loss of 1,400 jobs after the closure of the third-shift assembly line in 2005, after two years in operation. Holden fared better in 2007, posting an A$6 million loss. This was followed by an A$70.2 million loss in the 2008, an A$210.6 million loss in 2009, and a profit of A$112 million in 2010. On 18 May 2005, \"Holden Ltd\" became \"GM Holden Ltd\", coinciding with the resettling to the new Holden headquarters on 191 Salmon Street, Port Melbourne, Victoria.\nQuestion: Which part of Holden's title was added on May 18 2005?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: GM\n\nPassage: The battle began around 9:00 a.m. on August 1, 1789, as the Russian and Austrian artillery opened fire on the Turkish lines.   The Turks had fortified their camp with a line of entrenchments.  Ottoman troops in the Balkans were experienced at erecting field fortifications, which could include ditches, earthen ramparts, and wooden palisades and towers.  The Ottomans sortied from their defenses to attack the allies all along their battle line.  Allied artillery and musket fire drove the Turks back. Suvorov then attacked the Turkish right flank.  The Russian cavalry was repulsed, but the Russian infantry attack was successful.  The Turks were pushed back into their entrenchments under close range Russian fire.  On the Ottoman left, the Austrian infantry also threw back the defenders.  Defeated on both ends of their line, the Ottomans fled.  The victory was complete by 4:00 p.m.  The allies lacked the resources to pursue the Turks and advanced no farther into Ottoman territory. The Turkish casualties numbered 1,500 dead and 2,500 wounded.  Allied casualties amounted to 800. The allies had captured 12 Ottoman guns.\nQuestion: Who had more casualties, the Turks or the allies?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Turkish casualties numbered 1,500 dead, and 2,500 wounded, Allied casualties amounted to 800., \n\nPassage:  Still searching for their first win, the Bengals flew to Texas Stadium for a Week 5 interconference duel with the Dallas Cowboys.

They were opposed in this by French authorities, who continued to encourage the conflict, but Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Dummer announced a cessation of hostilities on 31 July 1725 following negotiations in March.:83 The terms of this preliminary agreement were negotiated by Dummer and Chiefs Loron and Wenemouet and applied only to the Penobscots at first. They were allowed to retain Jesuit priests, but the two parties were in disagreement concerning land titles and British sovereignty over the Wabanakis. The written agreement was translated into Abenaki by French Jesuit Etienne Lauverjat; Chief Loron immediately repudiated it, specifically rejecting claims of British sovereignty over him. Despite his disagreement, Loron pursued peace, sending wampum belts to other tribal leaders, although his envoys were unsuccessful in reaching Gray Lock, who continued his raiding expeditions. Peace treaties were signed in Maine on 15 December 1725 and in Nova Scotia on 15 June 1726, involving a large number of tribal chiefs. The peace was reconfirmed by all except Gray Lock at a major gathering at Falmouth in the summer of 1727; other tribal envoys claimed that they were not able to locate him.

                    "Passage: In a rematch of their only loss so far this season, the Patriots faced the Buffalo Bills in a road game. After taking the opening kick, the Bills raced 70 yards all the way to the Patriots 5, but the Patriots defense kept Buffalo out of the end zone, forcing them to kick a 23-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Walt Powell forced Matthew Slater to fumble, but Shea McClellin recovered for the Patriots at their own 30. The Patriots drained over half of the remainder of the first quarter, going 70 yards to score on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Amendola. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots were given good field at the Bills 45. An offensive pass interference penalty on Amendola moved the ball back to the Patriots 45, but a holding penalty on Robert Blanton of the Bills moved the ball to mid field. A two-yard run by Blount and incomplete pass brought up a 3rd-and-8 from the Bills 48, and Brady hit Edelman with a 47-yard bomb to the 1-yard line, but the gain was nullified on an ineligible man downfield penalty on Marcus Cannon moving the ball back to the Patriots 47. Then Brady hit Hogan on a 53-yard touchdown bomb, increasing the lead to 14-3. Four possessions later, the Bills raced 59 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on a Mike Gillislee 3-yard touchdown rush. After Amendola returned the ball 24 yards to the Patriots 21, the Patriots countered, using just four plays and Brady found Gronkowski on a 53-yard touchdown, increasing the lead to 21-10. The Bills raced 44 yards in 11 plays to the Patriots 31 on their ensuing possession, but Carpenter missed a 49-yard field goal after it hit the upright. Taking over at their own 39, a 6-yard pass to White, a 15-yard pass to Amendola, and a 7-yard pass to Edelman led the Patriot to Bills 33 and Gostkowski kicked a 51-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 24-10 lead at halftime. Amendola kicked off the second half with fireworks, returning the kick 73 yards to the Bills 24. Two plays later, Brady hit Edelman for a 12-yard touchdown pass, extending the lead to 31-10. The Bills didn't quit, though, using a marathon 75-yard, six minute drive, concluding with Taylor splitting the defense for a 26-yard touchdown run, making it a game again with a 31-17 score. The Patriots countered right back, engineering an 11-play, 75-yard drive with LeGarrette Blount chalking up a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 38-17 late in the third quarter. Using Reggie Bush 35 yard kick return, the Bills drove 50 yards to the Patriots 10 in just 4 plays, but on the first play of the fourth quarter, a Taylor pass bounced off the fingertips of Charles Clay and the Bills turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots put the game away on their next drive, marching 76-yards in 13 plays, taking 7:49 off the clock, with Gostkowski adding a 32-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 41-17 lead with just 7:06 remaining in the game. The Bills drove 52 yards to the Patriots 32 on their next drive, but turned the ball over on downs when Robert Woods was tackled 1-yard short of the first down by Malcolm Butler. The Bills forced a Patriots punt and raced 66 yards in 6 plays, scoring a touchdown on a 1-yard touchdown run by Jonathan Williams with a two-point conversion on a two-yard pass from backup quarterback EJ Manuel to Nick O'Leary trimming the score to 41-25, but only 0:30 remained. After recovering the onside kick, the Patriots took a knee to win the game. Brady was 22/33 for 315 yards and had four touchdown passes to four different receivers (Danny Amendola, Chris Hogan, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman); LeGarette Blount added a running touchdown and Stephen Gostkowski a field goal. Heading into their bye week, the Patriots improved to 7-1, the best record in the league.\nQuestion: How many touchdowns did the Bills have in the first half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1, \n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their Monday Night loss in Atlanta, the Broncos returned home for an AFC duel with the Houston Texans. The Broncos jumped out to a 5-0 lead in the first quarter, with defensive end Elvis Dumervil sacking Texans' quarterback Matt Schaub in the end zone for a safety, followed by a 32-yard field goal placekicker Matt Prater. However, the Texans would reel off 21 unanswered points, with Schaub throwing three touchdown passes&#8212;a 60-yarder to wide receiver Andre Johnson, followed in the second quarter by a 3-yarder to running back Arian Foster and a 52-yarder to wide receiver Kevin Walter. The Broncos narrowed the Texans' lead to 21-11 at halftime, with a pair of field goals by Prater&#8212;from 23 and 53 yards. The Texans increased their lead in the third quarter, with a 41-yard field goal by placekicker Shayne Graham, followed by a 14-yard touchdown pass from Schaub to tight end Owen Daniels. Trailing 31-11 with 10:20 remaining in the fourth quarter, the Broncos tried to rally, with quarterback Peyton Manning throwing a pair of touchdown passes&#8212;a 38-yarder to wide receiver Brandon Stokley and a 6-yarder to tight end Joel Dreessen to narrow Houston's lead to 31-25 with three minutes remaining. After forcing a Texans' punt, the Broncos got the football back with 20 seconds remaining, but the Texans' defense stood their ground. Former wide receiver Rod Smith, who played with the Broncos from 1994-2007, was inducted into the Broncos Ring of Fame during halftime. Smith is the Broncos' franchise leader in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns.\nQuestion: Which player kicked the second longest field goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Shayne Graham\n\nPassage: General Yudenich, the Russian commander from 1915 to 1916, drove the Turks out of most of the southern Caucasus with a string of victories. In 1917, Russian Grand Duke Nicholas assumed command of the Caucasus front. Nicholas planned a railway from Russian Georgia to the conquered territories, so that fresh supplies could be brought up for a new offensive in 1917. However, in March 1917 , the Czar abdicated in the course of the February Revolution, and the Russian Caucasus Army began to fall apart. The Arab Revolt, instigated by the Arab bureau of the British Foreign Office, started June 1916 with the Battle of Mecca, led by Sherif Hussein of Mecca, and ended with the Ottoman surrender of Damascus. Fakhri Pasha, the Ottoman commander of Medina, resisted for more than two and half years during the Siege of Medina before surrendering in January 1919. The Senussi tribe, along the border of Italian Libya and British Egypt, incited and armed by the Turks, waged a small-scale guerrilla war against Allied troops. The British were forced to dispatch 12,000 troops to oppose them in the Senussi Campaign. Their rebellion was finally crushed in mid-1916. Total Allied casualties on the Ottoman fronts amounted 650,000 men. Total Ottoman casualties were 725,000 .\nQuestion: How many years was General Yudenich a Russian commander?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1, \n\nPassage:  Still searching for their first win, the Bengals flew to Texas Stadium for a Week 5 interconference duel with the Dallas Cowboys.  In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Cowboys kicker Nick Folk got a 30-yard field goal, along with RB Felix Jones getting a 33-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Dallas increased its lead as QB Tony Romo completed a 4-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten.  The Bengals would end the half with kicker Shayne Graham getting a 41-yard and a 31-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Cincinnati tried to rally as QB Carson Palmer completed an 18-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh.  In the fourth quarter, the Bengals got closer as Graham got a 40-yard field goal, yet the Cowboys answered with Romo completing a 57-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.  Cincinnati tried to come back as Palmer completed a 10-yard TD pass to Houshmandzadeh (with a failed 2-point conversion), but Dallas pulled away with Romo completing a 15-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.\nQuestion: How many wins did the Bengals have before this game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: Looking to secure their third straight win and another division title, the Patriots returned home to face the 7-7 Jaguars. After the Jaguars deferred the opening coin toss, the Patriots received the opening kickoff to begin a 10-play, 82-yard drive. On a 1st-and-goal run from the Jaguars' 1-yard line, Maroney fumbled before breaking the plane of the goal line; it was recovered by Jaguars linebacker Daryl Smith at the 1-yard line. The Jaguars reached their own 35-yard line on their ensuing possession before failing to convert on a fourth down attempt, turning the ball back over the Patriots. Two plays after a 21-yard Morris run, Brady and Moss connected on a 2-yard touchdown reception to give the Patriots a 7-0 lead. After the kickoff, the Jaguars drove to the Patriots' 42-yard line before a David Garrard pass intended for Marcedes Lewis was intercepted by Meriweather at the Patriots' 17-yard line and returned 56 yards. Two plays later, on the first play of the second quarter, Brady threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Baker to extend the Patriots' lead to 14-0. The Jaguars continued to move the ball on their next possession, reaching midfield on completions of 15 and 14 yards; however a false start penalty negated another 15-yard reception and the Jaguars were forced to punt. Following a Patriots' three-and-out, Garrard was strip-sacked by Banta-Cain on the first play of the Jaguars' next-drive; tackle Eben Britton recovered the fumble for the Jaguars, who punted three plays later. On the third play of their ensuing drive, the Patriots moved into the red zone on a 55-yard Morris run, and later took a 21-0 lead on a 1-yard Morris touchdown run. After another Jaguars three-and-out, the Patriots moved into Jaguars territory on a 29-yard Welker catch and later extended their lead to 28-0 on a 6-yard touchdown reception by Moss. This would remain the score after the Jaguars ended the half on another punt. The Jaguars began the second half with a 16-play, 69-yard drive that took over eight minutes off the clock; however, it ended without any points after Garrard was intercepted by Springs at the Patriots' 2-yard line on a 3rd-and-goal from the 5-yard line. The Patriots responded with a 10-play, 90-yard drive of their own, despite a false start penalty to begin it. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Brady hit Moss on his third touchdown catch of the game, putting the Patriots ahead 35-0. However, the Jaguars responded quickly, moving past midfield on a 22-yard Rashad Jennings run and into the red zone on a 20-yard Nate Hughes reception. Two plays later, Garrard scrambled two yards for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 35-7. With 12:41 remaining in the game, the Patriots received the ball after the kickoff. What ensued was a 20-play drive, with the Patriots reaching midfield with about ten minutes remaining in the game, and reaching the Jaguars' 10-yard line by the two-minute warning. The drive included five first downs, including two off fourth down conversions. One play after the two-minute warning, Hoyer replaced Brady at quarterback, and one play later, the Patriots turned the ball over on downs after a failed 4th-and-2 run by Morris. The Jaguars, with 29 seconds left in the game, ran one play to end the game. With the win, the Patriots secured their first division title since 2007 and posted a 10-5 record heading into the final week of the season.\nQuestion: Which two players had rushing touchdowns?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Morris, Garrard\n\nPassage: As of the 2015 5-year ACS, the median income for a household in the county was $51,968, and the median income for a family was $61,809. Of full-time workers, males had a median income of $46,372 versus $39,690 for females. The per capita income for the county was $28,381. About 11.2% of families and 14.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 19.9% of those under the age 18 and 12.6% of those aged 65 or over.\nQuestion: Which had a higher median income, males or females?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: males\n\nPassage: In the county, the population was spread out with 29.60% under the age of 18, 6.40% from 18 to 24, 31.70% from 25 to 44, 23.40% from 45 to 64, and 8.90% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females there were 97.30 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.00 males.\nQuestion: How many more females per 100 were there than males 18 or over?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 6\n\nPassage:  Still searching for their first win, the Bengals flew to Texas Stadium for a Week 5 interconference duel with the Dallas Cowboys.

                    "Passage: On November 13, 1982, 15-year-old Scott Safran of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, set a world record of 41,336,440 points on the arcade game Asteroids, beating the 40,101,910 point score set by Leo Daniels of Carolina Beach on February 6, 1982. In 1998, to congratulate Safran on his accomplishment, the Twin Galaxies Intergalactic Scoreboard searched for him for four years until 2002, when it was discovered that he had died in an accident in 1989. In a ceremony in Philadelphia on April 27, 2002, Walter Day of Twin Galaxies presented an award to the surviving members of Safrans family, commemorating the Asteroid Champions achievement. On April 5, 2010, John McAllister broke Safrans record with a high score of 41,838,740 in a 58-hour Internet livestream.\nQuestion: Who had the highest score second playing  Asteroids, Safran, Daniels or Mc Allister?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Safran\n\nPassage: The Portuguese Restoration War  was the name given by nineteenth-century Romantic historians to the war between Portugal and Spain that began with the Portuguese revolution of 1640 and ended with the Treaty of Lisbon in 1668. The revolution of 1640 ended the 60-year Iberian Union. The period from 1640 to 1668 was marked by periodic skirmishes between Portugal and Spain, as well as short episodes of more serious warfare, much of it occasioned by Spanish and Portuguese entanglements with non-Iberian powers. Spain was involved in the Thirty Years' War until 1648 and the Franco-Spanish War until 1659, while Portugal was involved in the Dutch-Portuguese War until 1663. In the seventeenth century and afterwards, this period of sporadic conflict was simply known, in Portugal and elsewhere, as the Acclamation War. The war established the House of Braganza as Portugal's new ruling dynasty, replacing the House of Habsburg. This ended the so-called Iberian Union.\nQuestion: What happened second: Portuguese revolution or the Treaty of Lisbon?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: the Treaty of Lisbon, \n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Saints, the 49ers went home for a Week 5 interconference duel with the New England Patriots.  In the first quarter, the Niners struck first as QB J.T. O'Sullivan completed a 16-yard TD pass to RB Frank Gore.  The Patriots responded with QB Matt Cassel completing a 66-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss, yet San Francisco answered with O'Sullivan completing a 35-yard TD pass to WR Isaac Bruce.  In the second quarter, New England took the lead as kicker Stephen Gostkowski got a 35-yard field goal, along with RB Kevin Faulk getting a 2-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Patriots increased their lead with Faulk getting another 2-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, New England added on to its lead with Gostkowski kicking a 40-yard field goal.  The Niners tried to come back as O'Sullivan completed a 5-yard TD pass to Bruce, but the Patriots pulled away with Gostkowski nailing a 49-yard field goal. During the halftime ceremony, the 49ers retired former QB Steve Young's #8 uniform.\nQuestion: Which player scored the last points of the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Gostkowski\n\nPassage:  Still searching for their first win, the Bengals flew to Texas Stadium for a Week 5 interconference duel with the Dallas Cowboys.  In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Cowboys kicker Nick Folk got a 30-yard field goal, along with RB Felix Jones getting a 33-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Dallas increased its lead as QB Tony Romo completed a 4-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten.  The Bengals would end the half with kicker Shayne Graham getting a 41-yard and a 31-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Cincinnati tried to rally as QB Carson Palmer completed an 18-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh.  In the fourth quarter, the Bengals got closer as Graham got a 40-yard field goal, yet the Cowboys answered with Romo completing a 57-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.

                    "Passage: Coming off a bad loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, the Jaguars looked to rebound against their division rival Indianapolis Colts. Indianapolis scored on its first possession as running back Joseph Addai ran it in from two yards out to make the score 7-0 Colts. After two touchdown runs by David Garrard and Maurice Jones-Drew, the Jaguars took the lead in the second quarter, 14-7. Their lead didn't last very long as quarterback Peyton Manning threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dallas Clark, tying the game at 14 heading into halftime. The Jaguars regained the lead in the third quarter with Garrard finding tight end Marcedes Lewis for a fifteen-yard touchdown pass. Jacksonville took the lead 21-14. Once again, the Colts responded when Addai scored on a two-yard touchdown run tying the game at 21. With 2:13 left in the game, Garrard completed it to Maurice Jones-Drew for an eight-yard touchdown pass and the Jaguars took a 28-21 lead. That was enough time for 4 time MVP Peyton Manning, however as he hooked up with wide receiver Austin Collie for a one-yard touchdown that appeared as if it would send the game into overtime. The Jaguars got the ball back with 0:42 left on the clock, with the game tied. After a few short plays, the ball was at the Jacksonville 37-yard line with 0:33 left to play. Garrard then threw a deep pass to wide receiver Tiquan Underwood who caught it along the left sideline with 0:18 remaining in the game. Two plays later, kicker Josh Scobee lined up for a fifty-nine-yard field goal to win the game. Scobee's kick set a record for longest field goal in Jaguars franchise history.\nQuestion: Which player had a rushing and a receiving touchdown?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Maurice Jones-Drew\n\nPassage: Prince George of Greece was replaced by Alexandros Zaimis, a former Greek prime minister, for a five-year term beginning on 18 September 1906. From June 1906, an agreement between the former rebels of Theriso and the Cretan Assembly allowed for the creation of a constituent assembly led by Antonios Michelidakis. On 2 December, this body submitted a new constitution to Zaimis, who then swore allegiance to it. Order gradually returned to the island. A public administration was set up and laws passed for improving the health and education systems. In July 1907, Michelidakis was elected president of the Cretan Assembly, defeating Konstantinos Foumis by 34 to 31 votes. Impressed by the efforts the Cretan government had made, and having received assurances regarding the safety of the Muslim population, the European powers decided to send their troops home. On 26 August 1908, the first French contingents embarked at Chania, paving the way for a complete evacuation of the island.\nQuestion: Who was the first person to pledge allegiance to the new constitution?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Alexandros Zaimis\n\nPassage: The persecutions did not end, however. In violation of the promise made by Beria to the arrested opposition leaders, mass arrests and executions continued. The political guidance of the anti-revolt operations was effected by the GPU chief in Georgia, Solomon Mogilevsky, and the repressions were largely supported by the Transcaucasian Central Committee. Stalin himself is quoted to have vowed that \"all of Georgia must be plowed under\". In a series of raids, the Red Army and Cheka detachments killed thousands of civilians, exterminating entire families including women and children. Mass executions took place in prisons, where people were killed without trial, including even those in prison at the time of the rebellion. Hundreds of arrested were shot directly in railway trunks, so that the dead bodies could be removed faster\u2014a new and effective technical invention by the Cheka officer, Talakhadze. The exact number of casualties and the victims of the purges remains unknown. Approximately 3,000 died in fighting. The number of those who were executed during the uprising or in its immediate aftermath amounted to 7,000-10,000 or even more. According to the most recent accounts included also in The Black Book of Communism , 12,578 people were put to death from 29 August to 5 September 1924. About 20,000 people were deported to Siberia and Central Asian deserts.\nQuestion: How many more people were executed than died fighting?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 7000, \n\nPassage:  Still searching for their first win, the Bengals flew to Texas Stadium for a Week 5 interconference duel with the Dallas Cowboys.

                    "Passage: Using newly captured French ports, the German Navy enjoyed success against an over-extended Royal Navy, using U-boats against British shipping in the Atlantic. The British Home Fleet scored a significant victory on 27\u00a0May 1941 by sinking the German battleship Bismarck. In November 1939, the United States, who were taking measures to assist China and the Western Allies, amended the Neutrality Act to allow \"cash and carry\" purchases by the Allies. In 1940, following the German capture of Paris, the size of the United States Navy was significantly increased. In September the United States further agreed to a trade of American destroyers for British bases. Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941. In December 1940 Roosevelt accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the US to become an \"arsenal of democracy\" and promoted Lend-Lease programmes of aid to support the British war effort. The US started strategic planning to prepare for a full scale offensive against Germany. At the end of September 1940, the Tripartite Pact formally united Japan, Italy and Germany as the Axis Powers. The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country, with the exception of the Soviet Union, which attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three. The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia and Romania joined. Romania and Hungary would make major contributions to the Axis war against the USSR; in Romania's case partially to recapture territory ceded to the USSR.\nQuestion: When did the first members of the Axis Powers form?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: September 1940, \n\nPassage: Coming off their win over the Seahawks the Chiefs played on home ground for an AFC West rivalry rematch against the Broncos. The Chiefs took the early lead as QB Matt Cassel got a 2-yard TD pass to TE Leonard Pope. The Broncos replied with kicker Matt Prater getting a 25-yard field goal, but the Chiefs increased their lead with kicker Ryan Succop nailing a 47-yard field goal. The lead was narrowed when Prater nailed a 41-yard field goal.\nQuestion: How many total field goal yards did Matt Prater kick?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 66, \n\nPassage: Tampa Bay lost their fourth game out of the last five, falling to Houston by the score of 37-9. On the first play of the game, Matt Schaub completed a pass to Jacoby Jones, who proceeded to go for an 80-yard touchdown. In the second quarter, Arian Foster had a 78-yard touchdown reception from Schaub, and the Texans were in control of the game throughout. Josh Freeman threw three interceptions, two of which led to touchdowns for Houston.\nQuestion: How many games did Tampa Bay win in their last five?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1, \n\nPassage:  Still searching for their first win, the Bengals flew to Texas Stadium for a Week 5 interconference duel with the Dallas Cowboys.  In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Cowboys kicker Nick Folk got a 30-yard field goal, along with RB Felix Jones getting a 33-yard TD run.

On 1 January 2008, a number of 2,019,629 units, including military of 1,134,800 units, was set. In 2010 the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) estimated that the Russian Armed Forces numbered about 1,027,000 active troops and in the region of 2,035,000 reserves (largely ex-conscripts). As opposed to personnel specified by decree, actual personnel numbers on the payroll was reported by the Audit Chamber of Russia as 766,000 in October 2013. As of December 2016, the armed forces are at 93 percent of the required manpower, up from 82 percent reported in December 2013.\nQuestion: How many more Russian reserves are there than active troops?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1008000, \n\nPassage: Hoping to take the stronghold by surprise, on May 7 Pontiac entered Fort Detroit with about 300 men carrying concealed weapons. The British had learned of Pontiac's plan, however, and were armed and ready. His tactic foiled, Pontiac withdrew after a brief council and, two days later, laid siege to the fort. Pontiac and his allies killed all of the British soldiers and settlers they could find outside of the fort, including women and children. One of the soldiers was ritually cannibalized, as was the custom in some Great Lakes Native cultures. The violence was directed at the British; French colonists were generally left alone. Eventually more than 900 soldiers from a half-dozen tribes joined the siege. Meanwhile, on May 28 a British supply column from Fort Niagara led by Lieutenant Abraham Cuyler was ambushed and defeated at Point Pelee. After receiving reinforcements, the British attempted to make a surprise attack on Pontiac's encampment. But Pontiac was ready and waiting, and defeated them at the Battle of Bloody Run on July 31, 1763. Nevertheless, the situation at Fort Detroit remained a stalemate, and Pontiac's influence among his followers began to wane. Groups of Native Americans began to abandon the siege, some of them making peace with the British before departing. On October 31, 1763, finally convinced that the French in Illinois would not come to his aid at Detroit, Pontiac lifted the siege and removed to the Maumee River, where he continued his efforts to rally resistance against the British.\nQuestion: How many days passed between Pontiac defeating them at the Battle of Bloody Run and his withdrawal to the Maumee River?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 92, \n\nPassage:  Still searching for their first win, the Bengals flew to Texas Stadium for a Week 5 interconference duel with the Dallas Cowboys.

                    "Passage: In 2007, there were 101,480 people residing in Ancona (the greater area has a population more than four times its size), located in the province of Ancona, Marches, of whom 47.6% were male and 52.4% were female. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 15.54 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 24.06 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners). The average age of Ancona resident is 48 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Ancona grew by 1.48 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent. The current birth rate of Ancona is 8.14 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.\nQuestion: Between 2002 and 2007, how many more percentage points did the population of Italy grow than the population of Ancona?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2.08\n\nPassage: Still looking for a win the Panthers played on home ground for an NFC duel with the Bears. In the 1st quarter the Panthers trailed early as RB Matt Forte got an 18-yard TD run. The Panthers replied with kicker John Kasay making a 24-yard field goal. The Panthers fell further behind with Forte making a 68-yard TD run, followed by a 28-yard field goal from kicker Robbie Gould. In the third quarter the Panthers replied with Kasay making a 53-yard field goal, but in the 4th quarter the Bears pulled away when Gould made a 53 and a 43-yard field goal.\nQuestion: Which player kicked the shortest field goal of the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: John Kasay\n\nPassage: In a game that various analysts considered a potential Super Bowl XLVII preview, the 7-1 Bears faced the also 7-1 Houston Texans on Sunday Night Football, in a game waged in the rain. The first half proved disastrous for Chicago, as Kellen Davis had the ball stripped by former Bear Danieal Manning, and recovered by Texans linebacker Tim Dobbins. Shayne Graham later kicked a 20-yard field goal to give Houston the first points of the game. On Chicago's next possession, Michael Bush fumbled, and the Texans recovered again. The Texans drive wouldn't last long, as Tim Jennings would intercept Matt Schaub. However, the Bears failed to take advantage of the turnover, as Jay Cutler's pass would get intercepted by Manning. A quarter later, Jennings once again intercepted Schaub, which set up a Robbie Gould 51-yard field goal. Later in the quarter, Justin Forsett broke a 25-yard run to the Bears 3-yard line, which set up Arian Foster's 2-yard touchdown catch. Late in the first half, Cutler was hit by Dobbins, giving him a concussion, which sidelined him for the rest of the game, and was replaced by Jason Campbell. With less than two minutes left in the third quarter, Gould hit a 24-yard field goal to draw the Bears within four points, but Graham would make a 42-yarder to increase the deficit to seven with less than five minutes left in the game. Gould had attempted a 48-yard field goal earlier in the fourth quarter, but the ball hit the left upright. The loss snapped Chicago's six-game winning streak, the longest since their seven-game streak in 2006, and dropped Chicago to a 7-2 record, and 0-3 all-time against the Texans.\nQuestion: How many more field goals did Gould make than Graham?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1\n\nPassage:  Still searching for their first win, the Bengals flew to Texas Stadium for a Week 5 interconference duel with the Dallas Cowboys.  In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Cowboys kicker Nick Folk got a 30-yard field goal, along with RB Felix Jones getting a 33-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Dallas increased its lead as QB Tony Romo completed a 4-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten.  The Bengals would end the half with kicker Shayne Graham getting a 41-yard and a 31-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Cincinnati tried to rally as QB Carson Palmer completed an 18-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh.  In the fourth quarter, the Bengals got closer as Graham got a 40-yard field goal, yet the Cowboys answered with Romo completing a 57-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.  Cincinnati tried to come back as Palmer completed a 10-yard TD pass to Houshmandzadeh (with a failed 2-point conversion), but Dallas pulled away with Romo completing a 15-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.\nQuestion: Which player had the longest touchdown reception?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: Going for their fourth-straight win, the Dolphins traveled to Ford Field for a Thanksgiving fight with the Detroit Lions.  This game would be marked as Dolphins QB Joey Harrington's return to Detroit, as he was constantly booed throughout the contest.  In the first quarter, Miami trailed as Lions QB Jon Kitna got Detroit off to a fast start.  Kitna would complete a 2-yard TD pass to TE Dan Campbell, while kicker Jason Hanson nailed a 52-yard field goal.  Afterwards, Harrington started to get the Dolphins back into business as he completed his first-ever Thanksgiving touchdown pass on an 8-yard strike to WR Marty Booker.  In the second quarter, Harrington acquired the only score of the period on a 5-yard TD pass to TE Randy McMichael.  In the third quarter, kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 42-yard field goal, while Harrington and Booker connected with each other again on a 19-yard TD pass.  In the fourth quarter, Mare managed to put the game away with a 28-yard field goal. RB Ronnie Brown only had 68 yards rushing (with 5 yards receiving), as he left the game early with a broken left hand. He is currently week-to-week and will likely miss the team's next game against Jacksonville. With the Dolphins victory, not only did the Dolphins improve to 5-6, but Harrington also got his second-ever Thanksgiving Day victory and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd touchdown pass ever on Thanksgiving Day.\nQuestion: How many yards longer was the longest field goal compared to the shortest?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 24\n\nPassage:  Entering their second game of the season against Baltimore, the Steelers' defense ranked first in the league, while the Ravens' defense ranked second. \"We're going to win by any means necessary. If the defense has to score, if the special teams have to kick in a score, or if the offense has to score 50 points - whatever it takes to win,\" stated James Harrison prior to the game. Both teams were held scoreless before a record crowd at M&T Bank Stadium until a Baltimore field goal gave the Ravens a 3-0 lead at 12:34 of the second quarter. Pittsburgh tied the game on a Jeff Reed field goal; Matt Stover converted a second time to give the Ravens a three-point lead at halftime. Stover kicked his third field goal of the game in the third quarter, extending their lead to six points. In the final quarter, Reed kicked his second field goal of the game to put the Steelers within three points. On the Steelers final drive of the game, the offense drove 92&#160;yards over 2:53, with Ben Roethlisberger completing a touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes with 50&#160;seconds remaining. The Ravens embarked on one more drive, but the Steelers second interception of the game prevented them from scoring. With the victory the Steelers won their second consecutive AFC North title and clinched a first round bye and became the first AFC franchise to amass 550&#160;wins.\nQuestion: Which player kicked the most field goals?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Matt Stover\n\nPassage: Coming off their overtime home win over the Seahawks, the Browns flew to Heinz Field for Round 2 of the 2007 Rust Belt series with the Pittsburgh Steelers. In the first quarter, Cleveland got off to a fast start as QB Derek Anderson completed a 4-yard TD pass to TE Kellen Winslow. The Steelers would respond with kicker Jeff Reed getting a 28-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Browns increased their lead with Anderson completing a 2-yard TD pass to FB Lawrence Vickers, while Pittsburgh only managed to have Reed kick 35-yard field goal. Afterwards, Cleveland continued its early pounding with Anderson completing a 16-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards, who managed to keep the tips of his feet inbounds. The Steelers would end the half with Reed kicking a 30-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Pittsburgh began to rally as QB Ben Roethlisberger completed a 12-yard TD pass to WR Hines Ward for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers took the lead as Roethlisberger got a 30-yard TD run. Fortunately, the Browns immediately responded as WR/KR Josh Cribbs returned a kickoff 100&#160;yards for a touchdown. However, Pittsburgh regained the lead with Roethlisberger completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Heath Miller. Cleveland managed to get a late drive and tried to force overtime, but kicker Phil Dawson's 53-yard field goal attempt fell short. With their ninth-straight loss to the Steelers, the Browns fell to 5-4. Edwards' only catch of the game, a 16-yard touchdown reception, gave him his 10th touchdown reception on the year. This would be the most in franchise history since 1969.\nQuestion: How many field goals did Reed kick in the first quarter?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1\n\nPassage:  Still searching for their first win, the Bengals flew to Texas Stadium for a Week 5 interconference duel with the Dallas Cowboys.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 and 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdams population died in 1623\u20131625, and again in 1635\u20131636, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u20131577 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629\u20131631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norways population died in 1348\u20131350. The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654.\nQuestion: How many years did the population of Norway die from a plague outbreak from 1348-1350?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2\n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their loss against the Steelers, the Titans went home for their Week 2 home opener against their AFC South foe, the Houston Texans.  Tennessee would strike first in the opening quarter as running back Chris Johnson got a 57-yard touchdown run.  The Texans would answer with quarterback Matt Schaub completing a 19-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Andre Johnson, yet the Titans would reply with quarterback Kerry Collins completing a 69-yard touchdown pass to Johnson.  Tennessee would add onto their lead in the second quarter as Collins completed an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Nate Washington.  However, Houston took the lead as Schaub completed a 72-yard touchdown pass to Johnson and a 29-yard touchdown pass to Jacoby Jones, followed by a 38-yard field goal from kicker Kris Brown.  The Titans would close out the half as kicker Rob Bironas made a 40-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Tennessee would regain the lead as Johnson got a 91-yard touchdown run.  The Texans would tie the game again as Schaub completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Owen Daniels.  In the fourth quarter, Houston took the lead as Brown nailed a 23-yard field goal.

After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins. They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover.",

                    "Passage: The Colts' eleventh game was an AFC duel against the Chargers. They took the lead in the first quarter after QB Peyton Manning made a 4-yard TD pass to TE Jacob Tamme. They had a problem maintaining this lead after kicker Nate Kaeding made a 28-yard field goal, followed by ILB Kevin Burnett returning an interception 29&#160;yards for a touchdown, and then with Kaeding hitting a 33 and a 50-yard field goal. They tried to cut the lead as Manning made a 6-yard TD pass to WR Blair White, but the Chargers controlled the second half with Kaeding getting a 30-yard field goal, which was shortly followed by FS Eric Weddle returning an interception 41&#160;yards for a touchdown, then with FB Mike Tolbert getting a 3-yard TD run, and Kaeding making a 20-yard field goal, settling both records to 6-5.  The Colts would have their 5- win season since 2002 at this point.\nQuestion: Which players received TD passes from Peyton Manning?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Jacob Tamme, Blair White\n\nPassage: The rebellion was ignited by the tax situation, where Eric showed arrogance by not negotiating with the four Estates of the Swedish realm at a Diet. In the summer of 1434, enraged miners and peasants burned the castle of Borgan\u00e4s near Borl\u00e4nge. The tension spread, causing several assaults on castles across the country. Nobleman Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson with mining interests in the Bergslagen area stood out as the rebel leader, commanding a peasant army. Negotiations with Eric took place in Vadstena in August 1434, but were unsuccessful. In January 1435 Engelbrekt summoned representatives from the four Estates to a Diet in Arboga, which later has been called the first Riksdag of the Estates. Engelbrekt was elected Captain of the Swedish realm. The antagonism abated when Eric promised changes for the better. However, as before, people felt these promises were not being fulfilled, hence the rebels picked up their axes once more. On April 27, 1436, a rebel army unit was sent marching towards Stockholm, where people still supported Eric due to the strong and influential Danish presence in the city. A certain degree of inner tension among the rebelling forces occurred because the Nobility and Clergy decided to support Karl Knutsson Bonde, who in 1436 had risen to the position of Riksh\u00f6vitsman. Neither dared remove Engelbrekt completely because of his strong support among the two lower Estates . However, Engelbrekt fell sick and became less active. In a twist of fate highly beneficial to Knutsson, Engelbrekt was assassinated on May 4 by M\u00e5ns Bengtsson , the cause being an unrelated personal conflict. Consequently, Knutsson won the power struggle . A man named Erik Puke attempted to rally Engelbrekt's old supporters in the Pukefejden, but it was too late. Puke was apprehended and executed in Stockholm in 1437.\nQuestion: Which event happened first, Negotiations with Eric taking place in Vadstena or a rebel army unit was sent marching towards Stockholm?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Negotiations with Eric, \n\nPassage: Though Chad Pennington was active and in uniform for the Jets, the team erred on the side of caution due to injured right ankle, instead starting second-year backup Kellen Clemens, who was making his first career start. The Ravens' defense welcomed him rudely on his first drive with an interception by Ed Reed. The Ravens were able to attain good field position consistently throughout the first half, and quarterback Kyle Boller (who himself was starting in place of an injured starting quarterback, Steve McNair), capitalized with a two-yard touchdown to Willis McGahee late in the first quarter. The teams traded field goals to start the second quarter; Jets kicker Mike Nugent hit a 50-yard field goal, followed by Matt Stover hitting a 28-yard attempt for the Ravens. After Stover missed a 46-yard try, the Jets tried to respond with Nugent attempting a 52-yard field goal, but Nugent missed wide left, his first miss in twenty attempts dating back to last season. Boller once again took advantage of the short field provided and hit tight end Todd Heap on a four-yard touchdown with six seconds left in the half to extend the Ravens' lead to 17-3. Heap's catch was initially ruled incomplete, but the call was subjected to a booth review and reversed, as replays showed he was able to touch both feet within the end zone. After a quiet third quarter, Stover hit a 43-yard field goal to start the fourth quarter, and extended Baltimore's lead to seventeen. Baltimore's defense, which ranked as the best in the NFL in 2006, was able to shut down Clemens and the Jets for most of the game, but Clemens was able to rally the team in the fourth quarter. Using a no huddle offense, Clemens drove the team down to the Baltimore three-yard line, before the Jets settled for a 21-yard field goal. On the Jets' next possession, 44 and 24-yard strikes by Clemens to Jerricho Cotchery got the Jets to the Ravens' goal line, where he found tight end Chris Baker for a three-yard touchdown, cutting the Jets' deficit to seven. Though the Jets failed to convert the ensuing onside kick, poor clock management by Boller gave the Jets the ball back with 2:38 left in the game. Clemens immediately found Cotchery on a 50-yard catch-and-run, later followed by a 24-yard pass to Laveranues Coles that brought the Jets' to the Baltimore seven-yard line with just over a minute to go. Clemens passed to Justin McCareins for a potential touchdown, but the pass was dropped by McCareins. A second pass to McCareins in the end zone deflected off him and into the arms of Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis for the game-ending interception. The loss made the Jets 8-20 since 2002 in games not started by Chad Pennington.\nQuestion: Which quarter did not have any points scored?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: third quarter\n\nPassage:  Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007. After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins. They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover.\nQuestion: What was the score at the end of the first quarter?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

There were 215,856 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 51.0% African American, 41.5% White American, 0.3% Native American, 1.3% Asian American, 0.0% Pacific Islander American, 3.6% from other races, and 2.2% from Multiracial American. Hispanic or Latino Americans of any race were 7.3% of the population. Ancestry (United States Census) include German Americans (15.2%), Irish American (10.9%), English American (8.7%), Italian American (5.6%), Polish American (3.2%), and French American (3.0%). Out of the total population, 4.5% were foreign born; of which 41.2% were born in Europe, 29.1% Asia, 22.4% Latin American, 5.0% Africa, and 1.9% Northern America.\nQuestion: How many percent of people were not white?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 58.5\n\nPassage: Coming off a divisional home win over the Dolphins, the Jets flew to Ralph Wilson Stadium for an AFC East showdown with the winless Buffalo Bills.  After a scoreless first half, New York trailed in the third quarter as Bills RB Marshawn Lynch got a 10-yard TD run.  The Jets would respond with QB Chad Pennington completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles.  In the fourth quarter, New York fell behind Buffalo again as kicker Rian Lindell nailed a 46-yard field goal and QB Trent Edwards completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE Michael Gaines.  The Jets managed to pull within three as RB Leon Washington got an 8-yard TD run.  After forcing a three-&-out, New York had one last chance to tie or take the lead.  Unfortunately, 8 plays into the drive, Pennington got intercepted by Bills CB Terrence McGee, which secured Buffalo's first win of the year.\nQuestion: How many yards did Lynch get in in his touchdown runs?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 10, \n\nPassage: In 1552 Charles V had borrowed over 4 million ducats, with the Metz campaign alone costing 2.5 million ducats. Shipments of treasure from the Indies totalled over two million ducats between 1552-53. By 1554, the cash deficit for the year was calculated to be over 4.3 million ducats, even after all tax receipts for the six ensuing years had been pledged and the proceeds spent in advance. Credit at this point began costing the crown 43 percent interest . By 1557 the crown was refusing payment from the Indies since even this was required for payment of the war effort . French finances during the war were mainly financed by the increase in the taille tax, as well as indirect taxes like the gabelle and customs fees. The French monarchy also resorted to heavy borrowings during the war from financiers at rates of 10-16 percent interest. The taille was estimated in collection for 1551 at around six million livres. During the 1550s, Spain had an estimated military manpower of around 150,000 soldiers, whereas France had an estimated manpower of 50,000.\nQuestion: How many more soldiers did Spain have compared to France during the 1550s?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 100000\n\nPassage:  Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007.

In the second quarter, the Cowboys struggled further with Garrard finding TE Marcedes Lewis on a 42-yard TD pass, then in the third quarter he found WR Mike Thomas on a 15-yard TD pass, and then he found Lewis again on a 9-yard TD pass. The Cowboys responded in the 4th quarter with RB Marion Barber getting a 1-yard TD run. But the Jaguars scored again with Garrard scrambling 2 yards to the endzone for a touchdown. The Cowboys replied with QB Jon Kitna making an 8-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten.\nQuestion: Who caught the most touchdown passes?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Marcedes Lewis\n\nPassage: As of the census of 2010, there were 31,894 people, 13,324 households, and 8,201 families residing in the city.

After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins. They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover.\nQuestion: how many yards did Hall intercept?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

The population density was 3,698 inhabitants per square mile (1,428/km\u00b2) including the airport. There were 285,797 housing units at an average density of 1,751 per square mile (676/km\u00b2). However, the average density throughout most Denver neighborhoods tends to be higher. Without the 80249 zip code (47.3 sq mi, 8,407 residents) near the airport, the average density increases to around 5,470 per square mile.Age distribution was 22.0% under the age of 18, 10.7% from 18 to 24, 36.1% from 25 to 44, 20.0% from 45 to 64, and 11.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age is 33 years. Overall there were 102.1 males for every 100 females, but in 2015 for the category of never-married ages 25 to 34, there were 121.4 males for every 100 females. Due to a skewed sex ratio wherein single men outnumber single women, some protologists have nicknamed the city as Menver.\nQuestion: Which age group is larger: 25 to 44 or 45 to 64?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 25 to 44\n\nPassage: The county was formed in 1752 from parts of Bladen, Granville, and Johnston Counties. It was named for the infant William V of Orange, whose mother Anne, daughter of King George II of Great Britain, was then regent of the Dutch Republic. In 1771, Orange County was greatly reduced in area. The western part of it was combined with the eastern part of Rowan County to form Guilford County. Another part was combined with parts of Cumberland County and Johnston County to form Wake County. The southern part of what remained became Chatham County. In 1777, the northern half of what was left of Orange County became Caswell County. In 1849, the western third of the still-shrinking county became Alamance County. Finally, in 1881, the eastern half of the county's remaining territory was combined with part of Wake County to form Durham County. Some of the first settlers of the county were English Quakers, who settled along the Haw and Eno Rivers. Arguably, the earliest settlers in the county were the Andrews family, which would later marry into the Lloyd family.\nQuestion: The county was formed in?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1752, \n\nPassage: The Lions went home for a Week 12 duel with another NFC South team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  In the first quarter, Detroit struck first as QB Daunte Culpepper completed a 15-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson.  The Lions continued their early success as safety Daniel Bullocks returned a fumble 44 yards for a touchdown, while kicker Jason Hanson got a 38-yard field goal. Although the 17-0 early advantage was the largest lead the Lions would obtain all year, it didn't even last until halftime.  In the second quarter, the Buccaneers' RB Warrick Dunn got a 13-yard TD run, while QB Jeff Garcia completed a 36-yard TD pass to WR Ike Hilliard and a 24-yard TD pass to TE Jerramy Stevens. In the third quarter, Tampa Bay added onto their lead as RB Clifton Smith returned a punt 70 yards for a touchdown, along with CB Ronde Barber returning an interception 65 yards for a touchdown.  Detroit scored when Hanson got a 40-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, only the Buccaneers scored when kicker Matt Bryant nailed a 48-yard field goal.\nQuestion: How many yards longer was Jason Hanson's second field goal compared to his first?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2\n\nPassage:  Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007.

Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins. They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover.",

                    "Passage: Coming off their divisional road win over the Redskins, the Cowboys went home, donned their throwback uniforms, and played a Week 12 game with the San Francisco 49ers. In the first quarter, Dallas trailed early as 49ers kicker Joe Nedney made a 23-yard and a 22-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Cowboys took a lead as QB Tony Romo completed a 75-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens, LB Carlos Polk blocked an Andy Lee punt into the back of the 49ers' endzone for a safety, kicker Nick Folk making a 48-yard and a 41-yard field goal, and Romo throwing a 45-yard pass to T.O., Then completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Martellus Bennett. In the third quarter, the Cowboys increased their lead as Romo completed a 10-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.  San Francisco answered with Nedney getting a 35-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the 'Boys replied with Folk getting a 47-yard field goal.  The 49ers would try to stay in pace as QB Shaun Hill completed an 18-yard TD pass to WR Isaac Bruce, yet Dallas pulled away as Folk nailed a 42-yard field goal.  The 49ers tried to come back as Hill completed a 9-yard TD pass to RB DeShaun Foster, yet Dallas's defense held from there on out. Terrell Owens, having gone through 14-straight games without having a 100-yard receiving day, snapped his futuility streak by having 7 catches for 213 yards and a touchdown.  His 213 receiving yards would be his 2nd-highest single game total in his career. Tony Romo finish with another 300 yard game giving him 13 300 yard games.\nQuestion: Which team was leading at the half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Cowboys\n\nPassage: The Eagles and Cincinnati Bengals played to a 13-13 tie.  Donovan McNabb turned the ball over on a sack at the end of the first quarter, leading to a Bengal field goal.  A 44-yard catch and run by Correll Buckhalter set up a 42-yard David Akers field goal to tie the score early in the second quarter.  McNabb was picked off in Bengal territory with less than two minutes left in the half, and Cincinnati scored four plays later on a 26-yard touchdown reception by T. J. Houshmandzadeh.  The Bengals added another field goal early in the third quarter to take a 13-3 lead.  Hank Baskett came up with a 57-yard completion, followed by a 4-yard touchdown reception by L.J. Smith to make it 13-10.  In the fourth quarter, Philadelphia tied the game on a field goal after a 13-play drive.  The offenses struggled throughout the rest of regulation and the game went to overtime.  The Eagles won the toss, but the Bengals had the field position advantage throughout most of overtime.  Nevertheless, neither team could score.  The Bengals had a chance to win on 47-yard field goal attempt by Shayne Graham, but the kick went wide right and the game ended in a tie.  McNabb passed for 338 yards and a touchdown, but had three interceptions (all in Cincinnati territory) and a lost fumble.  The defense registered eight sacks.  This was the first game in the NFL to end in a tie since the 2002 Falcons-Steelers game. It was also played 11 years to the day since the Eagles' last tie game.  After the game, several Philadelphia players, including Donovan McNabb, explained that they did not realize a game could end in a tie, causing controversy because this could have changed the strategy in the overtime period.  (This was a regular season game, so there was a limit of one overtime period.) With the tie, the Eagles fell to 5-4-1, putting them back into last place in the NFC East.\nQuestion: How many yards do T. J. Houshmandzadeh's touchdown and L.J. Smith's touchdown combine for?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 30\n\nPassage: The Rams' sixth game was an Interconference duel against the San Diego Chargers inside their dome. In the first quarter the Rams took the early lead as kicker Josh Brown made a 39-yard field goal, followed by QB Sam Bradford completing a 38-yard TD pass to WR Danario Alexander. The Rams increased their lead in the 2nd quarter when RB Steven Jackson got a 7-yard TD run. The Chargers replied with kicker Nate Kaeding nailing a 41-yard field goal, followed in the third quarter by FB Mike Tolbert getting a 1-yard TD run. In the 4th quarter the Rams' lead increased again when Josh Brown hit a 48-yard field goal, but was cut when QB Philip Rivers made a 5-yard TD pass to WR Buster Davis. With the win, the Rams improved to 3-3 snapping their 13-game losing streak against AFC Opponents.\nQuestion: Which player scored the last points of the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Buster Davis\n\nPassage:  Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007.

                    "Passage: During the Ottoman period, the citys population of Ottomans Muslims (including those of Turkish people and Albanians origin, as well as Bulgarian Muslim and Greek Muslim convert origin) grew substantially. According to the 1478 census Sel\u00e2nik (), as the city came to be known in Ottoman Turkish, had 6,094 Greek Orthodox households, 4,320 Muslim ones, and some Catholic. No Jews were recorded in the census suggesting that the subsequent influx of Jewish population was not linked to the already existing Romaniote Jews community. Soon after the turn of the 15th to 16th century, however, nearly 20,000 Sephardic Jews immigrated to Greece from the Iberian Peninsula following their expulsion from Spain by the 1492 Alhambra Decree. By c. 1500, the number of households had grown to 7,986 Greek ones, 8,575 Muslim ones, and 3,770 Jewish. By 1519, Sephardic Jewish households numbered 15,715, 54% of the citys population. Some historians consider the Ottoman regimes invitation to Jewish settlement was a strategy to prevent the ethnic Greek population from dominating the city.\nQuestion: How many more Muslims than Jews lived in Sel\u00e2nik by c. 1500?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 4805\n\nPassage: The Eagles opened their season on the road against the Atlanta Falcons. Other than the one-handed Kiko Alonso interception in the end zone, Atlanta dominated in the first half, while former Legion of Boom cornerback Byron Maxwell had trouble covering Julio Jones. DeMarco Murray also struggled in the first half, as he had a 12-yard loss on one run. In the second half, the Eagles opened up with an interception on Matt Ryan by Walter Thurmond and scored on their next 3 possessions, and took the lead late in the 4th quarter. However, Matt Bryant kicked a field goal to give the Falcons back a 26-24 lead and the Eagles had a chance to come back. However, the Eagles were stopped on 3rd & 1, and Cody Parkey missed a 44-yard field goal attempt. Malcolm Jenkins then made a critical stop on 3rd down to force a Falcons punt. The Eagles' next drive ended as Sam Bradford threw a pass to Jordan Matthews, but the ball bounced off him and was intercepted by the Falcons, sealing a Falcons' victory. Reigning NFL rushing champ DeMarco Murray had 8 carries for 9 yards, which included an 8-yard touchdown run. Backup Darren Sproles picked up the slack by averaging 10 yards per carry and catching 7 passes for 76 yards.\nQuestion: How many points did  the Eagles lose by?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2, \n\nPassage: Hoping to make it three straight the Chargers flew to Paul Brown Stadium for an AFC duel with the Bengals. In the first quarter the Chargers trailed early with QB Carson Palmer throwing a 3-yard TD pass to TE Jermaine Gresham. Then Palmer found WR Jerome Simpson on a 10-yard TD pass (PAT failed, wide left). The Chargers got on the board with kicker Nate Kaeding hitting a 20-yard field goal, followed by RB Ryan Mathews getting a 23-yard TD run, but went into more trouble as Palmer completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Jordan Shipley. The Chargers cut the lead with Kaeding making a 28-yard field goal, but struggled to hold on after Palmer connected to Simpson on a 59-yard TD pass, followed by RB Bernard Scott getting a 10-yard TD run. The Chargers tried to come back after QB Philip Rivers made a 5-yard TD pass to WR Kelley Washington, but the Bengals defense prevented any more scoring chances. With the loss, the Chargers fell to 8-7. With Kansas City winning earlier in the day, the loss prevented the Chargers from making their sixth playoff appearance in seven years.\nQuestion: How many is the difference in the number of yards of the TD pass caught by Gresham and the TD pass caught by Shipley?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 0, \n\nPassage:  Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007. After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins. They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover.\nQuestion: how many yards did Potter make?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: The Texans traveled to the RCA Dome for an AFC South battle with the Indianapolis Colts.  From the get-go, Houston trailed as opposing QB Peyton Manning threw a 10-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Stokley and a 21-yard pass to RB Joseph Addai in the first quarter.  In the second quarter, opposing Kicker Adam Vinatieri kicked a 39-yard field goal to further distance themselves from Houston.  The Texans would get a 43-yard field goal by Kicker Kris Brown, but Vinatieri also made a 43-yarder as time ran out in the half.  In the third quarter, the Colts continued to put the game out of reach with Peyton throwing a 15-yard TD pass to TE Bryan Fletcher and Vinatieri kicking a 38-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Texans QB David Carr completed a 33-yard TD pass to TE Owen Daniels, but Indianapolis responded with RB Dominic Rhodes getting a 2-yard TD run.  Houston would get another TD on a 1-yard pass to TE Mark Bruener, but the Colts put the game away with RB Ran Carthon getting a 3-yard TD run.  After WR Andre Johnson provided Houston with a 10-yard TD pass, the Texans ending up losing their ninth straight contest against Indianapolis.\nQuestion: Which players had scoring plays of 43 yards?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Adam Vinatieri, Kris Brown\n\nPassage: In week 13, the Lions visited the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens opened the scoring in the first quarter via a 38-yard field goal from Justin Tucker. The Ravens added 17 points in the second quarter via a one-yard touchdown pass from Joe Flacco to Benjamin Watson, a three-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to Patrick Ricard, and a 46-yard field goal from Tucker, giving the Ravens a 20-0 lead at the intermission. After half-time, the Lions finally got on the board and scored 13 points in the third quarter via a four-yard touchdown run from Theo Riddick, and a six-yard touchdown run from Tion Green (the first of his career), reducing the Ravens' lead to seven points. The Ravens responded with 24 points in the fourth quarter via a seven-yard touchdown run from Alex Collins, a 51-yard field goal from Tucker, a six-yard touchdown run from Collins, and a 45-yard interception return from Eric Weddle. The Lions scored via a one-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford to Nick Bellore, making the final score 44-20 in favor of Baltimore.\nQuestion: How many total points were scored in the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 64\n\nPassage: The Rams started their season on the road against the Lions. The Rams drew first blood in the first quarter with a 48-yard field goal from Greg Zuerlein to take a 3-0 lead for the only score of that quarter. The Lions then took a 7-3 lead with Joique Bell's 1-yard run for a touchdown in the 2nd quarter. The Rams responded with a 29-yard field goal from Zuerlein as they came up within a point 7-6 before on the Lions' next possession, Matthew Stafford was picked off by Cortland Finnegan and it was returned 31 yards for a touchdown as the Rams retook the lead 13-7. The Lions then responded with Jason Hanson kicking a 41-yard field goal to shorten the Rams' lead to 13-10 at halftime. After the break, the Lions scored first with Jason Hanson kicking a 45-yard field goal to tie the game 13-13 for the only score of the 3rd quarter. However, the Rams moved back into the lead in the 4th quarter with Brandon Gibson's 23-yard catch from Sam Bradford to make it 20-13. The Lions tied the game back up with Kevin Smith running for a touchdown from 5 yards out to tie the game 20-20. The Rams then retook the lead with Greg Zuerlein kicking a 46-yard field goal to make the score 23-20. On their last possession, the Lions moved down the field and Matthew Stafford found Kevin Smith on a 5-yard touchdown pass to make the final score 27-23 as the Rams began their season 0-1.\nQuestion: How many yards was the longest field goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 48, \n\nPassage:  Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007. After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins. They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover.\nQuestion: how many yards did Robinson score?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: The average high school graduation rate of blacks in the United States has steadily increased to 71% in 2013. Separating this statistic into component parts shows it varies greatly depending upon the state and the school district examined. 38% of black males graduated in the state of New York but in Maine 97% graduated and exceeded the white male graduation rate by 11 percentage points. In much of the southeastern United States and some parts of the southwestern United States the graduation rate of white males was in fact below 70% such as in Florida where a 62% of white males graduated high school. Examining specific school districts paints an even more complex picture. In the Detroit school district the graduation rate of black males was 20% but 7% for white males. In the New York City school district 28% of black males graduate high school compared to 57% of white males. In Newark County 76% of black males graduated compared to 67% for white males. Further academic improvement has occurred in 2015. Roughly 23% of all blacks have bachelors degrees. In 1988, 21% of whites had obtained a bachelors degree versus 11% of blacks. In 2015, 23% of blacks had obtained a bachelors degree versus 36% of whites. Foreign born blacks, 9% of the black population, made even greater strides. They exceed native born blacks by 10 percentage points.\nQuestion: How many more percentage of black people graduated in Maine than in New York?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 59\n\nPassage: Coming off their bye week the Rams flew to Candlestick Park for an NFC West rivalry match against the 49ers. In the first quarter the Rams took the lead with kicker Josh Brown making a 42-yard field goal. They trailed with RB Frank Gore getting a 1-yard TD run. This was followed in the second quarter by kicker Joe Nedney nailing a 26-yard field goal. The Rams fought back and took the lead with QB Sam Bradford completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR Danny Amendola. Followed in the third quarter by RB Steven Jackson getting a 13-yard TD run. The 49ers got the lead back with Nedney getting a 47-yard field goal, followed by QB Troy Smith making a 16-yard TD pass to WR Michael Crabtree. Te Rams tied the game with Brown making a 33-yard field goal. The decision was made at overtime when Nedney successfully put away a 29-yard field goal to give the Rams a loss, bringing their record down to 4-5.\nQuestion: Which player scored the first points of the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Josh Brown, \n\nPassage: The Eagles returned from their Week 4 bye against an 0-4 Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, Philadelphia's second straight game against a winless team. Donovan McNabb and Brian Westbrook returned from injury but Kevin Curtis once again was inactive and Jeremy Maclin made his third consecutive start. On Donovan McNabb's first play back, he scrambled 13 yards, and on the very next play, he found wide receiver Jeremy Maclin deep in the end zone for a 51-yard touchdown. In the second quarter, Donovan McNabb hit fullback Leonard Weaver in the flat and Weaver took it in for a 20-yard touchdown. The Buccaneers answered soon after as quarterback Josh Johnson, making his second career NFL start, connected with tight end Kellen Winslow in the end one for a nine-yard score. The Eagles ended the second half with another McNabb-to-Maclin TD hookup, this one of 40 yards. In the third quarter, the two teams fought back and forth but the only score was for Philadelphia as running back Brian Westbrook, one play after lining up wide and catching a twenty-yard pass from McNabb, ran the ball seven yards into the end zone to put the Eagles up 28-7. Kicker David Akers booted a 44-yard field goal in the fourth quarter to put Philly up 31-7, but the Bucs fought back as Josh Johnson and Kellen Winslow hooked up again on another nine-yard touchdown. After a Sav Rocca punt left the Buccaneers deep in their own territory, DE Darren Howard tackled Tampa Bay halfback Carnell \"Cadillac\" Williams in the end zone for a safety. The final score was 33-14 as the Eagles improved to 3-1.  Andy Reid earned his 100th career victory with the Eagles.  The Eagles are 11-0 after their bye week under Andy Reid.\nQuestion: What did McNabb do on the second play of the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 51-yard touchdown, \n\nPassage:  Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007.

After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins. They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover.",

                    "Passage: The population was spread out with 39,128 people (20.6%) under the age of 18, 15,906 people (8.4%) aged 18 to 24, 54,024 people (28.4%) aged 25 to 44, 53,978 people (28.4%) aged 45 to 64, and 26,956 people (14.2%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40.2 years. For every 100 females, there were 98.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.6 males.\nQuestion: Which groups in percent are larger than 16%?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: under the age of 18, 25 to 44, 45 to 64\n\nPassage: Coming off their thrilling overtime win over the Packers, the Redskins stayed at home for a Week 6 interconference duel with the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday night.  Washington trailed early in the first quarter as Colts quarterback Peyton Manning completed a 57-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Pierre Gar&#231;on.  The Redskins answered with a 9-yard touchdown run from running back Ryan Torain.  Indianapolis struck back in the second quarter as Manning threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Austin Collie, followed by kicker Adam Vinatieri's 43-yard field goal. Washington began to claw back into the game in the third quarter as Torain got a 1-yard touchdown run, but the Colts continued to flex their offensive muscle as running back Joseph Addai got a 13-yard touchdown run.  The Redskins continued to stay close as kicker Graham Gano booting a 39-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Indianapolis continued to add onto their lead as Vinatieri made a 33-yard field goal.  Washington tried to rally as quarterback Donovan McNabb hooked up with running back Keiland Williams on an 8-yard touchdown pass, but the Colts' defense would prevent any further progress.\nQuestion: Which team had the longest play of the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Colts\n\nPassage: Broncos' fans were given several reasons to hope for the future during this road win against the similarly rookie quarterback led Cardinals. Denver scored first on a Javon Walker 54-yard pass from Jay Cutler in the 3rd minute of the first quarter. They scored again in the 6th minute of the first quarter on a 30-yard field goal compliments of Jason Elam. Elam tacked on another 3 in the second minute of the second quarter from 22 yards. The Cardinals got on the board in the 6th minute of the second quarter with a field goal from Neil Rackers. They scored again in the 7th minute on a fumble return for a touchdown by Antonio Smith for 4 yards after Tatum Bell lost the ball. Elam struck again from 30 yards in the 14th minute of the 2nd quarter. Denver went on to score 3 more TDs. One in the third on a 10-yard pass to Rod Smith and two more in the fourth both on 1-yard carries from Mike Bell. Arizona scored on an FG in the third from 38 yards compliments of Rackers and then on a touchdown in the fourth on a four-yard carry by Edgerrin James. The Broncos improved to 8-6 while the Cardinals fell to 4-10. Play-off Implications: Jay Cutler replacing Jake Plummer for his third regular season start had an impressive game with 21 completions on 31 attempts for 261 yards total. He had two TD passes and 1 interception. The run game while not impressive by Broncos' standards (106 yards team total with Mike Bell leading Tatum Bell (28 yards), with 61 yards on 16 carries) did provide enough of a threat to allow Cutler opportunities to make plays. After the Broncos' relatively stagnant last four games any semblance of an offensive rhythm is encouraging. The win in Arizona kept Bronco play-off hopes alive and set up an exciting must-win situation against the Cincinnati Bengals in week 16. The Broncos can clinch a wild card playoff berth with a win against the Bengals and a loss by the KC Chiefs along with a loss by either the NY Jets or the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nQuestion: How many yards longer was Elam's longest field goal kick than his shortest in the first half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 8\n\nPassage:  Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007.

                    "Passage:  Carolina had a rough start in the first half, only scoring seven points, and went into halftime seventeen points behind Oakland. They turned things around and had an explosive third quarter scoring eighteen points giving them a one-point lead over the Raiders. In the fourth quarter the Panthers went on to score seven but the Raiders answered back tying the game. In their last possession of the game the ball was taken from Cam Newton giving Oakland the ball back. Carolina could not hold on as Oakland kicked a field goal winning the game. They fall to 4-7.\nQuestion: How many losses did Carolina have going into this game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 6\n\nPassage: Coming off their MNF home win over the Jets, the Chargers flew to Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum for a Week 4 AFC West duel with the Oakland Raiders.  In the first quarter, the 'Bolts trailed early as Raiders kicker Sebastian Janikowski got a 22-yard field goal, along with Safety Gibril Wilson sacking QB Philip Rivers in his endzone for a safety.  In the second quarter, San Diego continued to trail as QB JaMarcus Russell completed a 63-yard TD pass to TE Zach Miller, along with Janikowski's 28-yard field goal. In the third quarter the Chargers began to rally as kicker Nate Kaeding made a 28-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the 'Bolts continued their rally as Rivers completed a 9-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates, along with RB LaDainian Tomlinson getting a 13-yard TD run (with a successful 2-point conversion pass from Rivers to RB Darren Sproles).  Oakland tried to respond as Janikowski got a 32-yard field goal, yet San Diego completed its comeback with Kaeding making a 47-yard field goal and Tomlinson rushing for a 41-yard TD run. Notable: Through 15 games against a single opponent, LaDainian Tomlinson set a new record in touchdowns and yards against an opponent previously held by Barry Sanders, 1,763 yards, and Marcus Allen, 20 Touchdowns, respectively, by totaling 1,815 yards and 21 touchdowns. In this game, Janikowski attempted and failed a 76-yard field goal.\nQuestion: Which player booted the longest field goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Nate Kaeding\n\nPassage: Coming off their win over the Saints, the Falcons stayed at home for a Week 11 interconference duel with the Denver Broncos.  In the first quarter, Atlanta trailed early as Broncos FB Peyton Hillis got a 7-yard TD run. The Falcons would answer with kicker Jason Elam (a former Bronco) getting a 46-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Atlanta took the lead as Elam made a 36-yard field goal, while RB Michael Turner got a 9-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Denver retook the lead as Hillis got a 2-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Broncos increased their lead as kicker Matt Prater nailed a 20-yard field goal.  The Falcons tried to rally as Turner got a 28-yard field goal, yet Denver replied with quarterback Jay Cutler competing a 9-yard TD pass to TE Daniel Graham.  From there on out, the Broncos' defense stopped any other possible comeback attempt. With their first home loss of the year, Atlanta fell to 6-4. This was the first of only two home losses suffered by Matt Ryan in the NFL through 12/27/2010. The second was to the New Orleans Saints on December 27, 2010, the final Monday Night Football game of the 2010 season.\nQuestion: How many touchdowns were there between 5 and 10 yards?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3\n\nPassage:  Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007. After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins. They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover.\nQuestion: Which player scored the final touchdown of the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

On 5 January 1242, Count Alphonse of Poiters called together the Poitevin nobles at Chinon for Easter. The faithful lords, and others less loyal but nonetheless enemies of Lusignan, responded to the appeal.  Although his mother Blanche of Castile had coped with baronial uprisings before and carried on the royal affairs since 1226, with the title \"baillistre\" , Louis IX decided to go to the assistance of his brother and forcibly take control of the County of La Marche. In April 1242, Louis assembled a force at Chinon that some contemporaries estimated at around 50,000. On 9 May, he marched against the castle of Montreuil-Bonnin, the fortress of Lusignan. After having seizing a multitude of rebel castles, he steered towards Saintes. On 20 May 1242, Henry and Richard departed Portsmouth for Royan and joined the rebelling French nobles, forming an army that may have numbered about 30,000. The two kings exchanged letters, but these resolved nothing. Henry had intentions to regain the past Angevin Empire of his predecessors on the basis that the title of Count of Poitou stills belonged to his brother, Richard. This was not the first war that Henry had waged in France either as he had earlier lead an expedition to France in 1230, however, Henry was convinced that Hugh would provide the necessary support to reverse the lackluster results of the last war. While completing his conquest of lower Poitou, he declared war on Saint Louis on 16 July. On 20 July, the French army arrived at Taillebourg where the inevitable clash took place.\nQuestion: Who was born first: Blanche of Castile or Count Alphonse of Poiters?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Blanche of Castile, \n\nPassage: The Seahawks' third game was played at home ground when they played their former division rival, the San Diego Chargers. In the second quarter Seattle took the early lead when kicker Olindo Mare made a 23-yard field goal. Then QB Matt Hasselbeck completed a 9-yard TD pass to TE John Carlson. This was followed in the third quarter by RB Leon Washington returning a kickoff 101 yards to the endzone for a touchdown. The lead was broken down with QB Philip Rivers getting a 3-yard TD pass to WR Malcolm Floyd, followed by Hasselbeck getting sacked by ILB Brandon Siler in the endzone for a safety. Then kicker Nate Kaeding made a 29-yard field goal. The Seahawks increased their lead when Mare made a 23-yard field goal, but the Chargers replied and tied the game when Rivers found TE Antonio Gates on a 12-yard TD pass. (With a successful 2-point conversion as Rivers found WR Legedu Naanee). Before the clock struck zero Seattle took the winning score as RB Leon Washington returned his second kickoff of the game into the endzone running 99 yards for a touchdown. Rivers and the Chargers attempted to make a comeback with less than a minute left, but was picked off by rookie Earl Thomas to seal the win for Seattle.\nQuestion: Which quarterback threw fewer touchdown passes?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Matt Hasselbeck, \n\nPassage:  Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007. After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins. They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover.\nQuestion: How many points did the Lions win by?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: Beginning a stretch of three straight home games, the Patriots faced off against the 9-3 Steelers in their first afternoon game in five weeks. Before the game, Steelers safety Anthony Smith guaranteed a win for the Steelers. After going three-and-out on their first drive, the Patriots fell behind 3-0 early on a 23-yard Jeff Reed field goal to cap an 8-minute, 15-play Steelers possession. A 39-yard Chad Jackson kickoff return gave the Patriots the ball at their own 48-yard line to begin a 9-play drive that ended in a 4-yard Moss touchdown catch to give the Patriots the lead. Moss' touchdown catch was his 18th of the season, surpassing Curtis Martin for the Patriots' record for touchdowns by a single player in a season. After a Steelers three-and-out the Patriots, on their first offensive play of the second quarter, increased their lead to 14-3 on a 63-yard play action pass from Brady to Moss. A 30-yard Willie Parker run on the Steelers' ensuing series set up a 32-yard touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger to Najeh Davenport. After a Patriots drive in which a muffed punt recovery by Pittsburgh led to a missed 48-yard field goal attempt by Gostkowski, the Steelers mounted a 12-play drive that lasted almost 6&#160;minutes before a 44-yard Reed field goal cut the Patriots' lead to 14-13. With 2:29 left in the half, a 32-yard Gaffney reception helped the Patriots drive to the Steelers' 24-yard line; after two Brady incompletions Gostkowski kicked a 42-yard Gostkowski field goal, giving the Patriots a 17-13 lead at halftime. On the Patriots' first drive of the second half, on 1st and 10 from their own 44-yard line, after a Brady lateral pass to Moss fell short, Moss picked it up and threw it back to Brady, who then found Gaffney deep for a 56-yard touchdown. After another Steelers three-and-out, the Patriots' second possession of the half also went for a touchdown, as a 2-yard Welker reception capped a 10-play drive that included one run, a 4-yard Brady scramble. In the opening minutes of the fourth quarter, the Steelers moved the ball to the Patriots' 1-yard line, but failed to score on 3rd and goal and 4th and goal. The Patriots took the ball at their own 1-yard line and then began a 6-minute, 12 play drive, passing on every down. Using a no-huddle offense, Welker caught five straight passes to bring the Patriots to the Steelers' 36-yard line. Brady completed four more passes to set up first-and-goal from the Steelers' 10-yard line, but his next three passes were all incomplete, leading to a 28-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Steelers' next possession, a 13-play drive, ended in another failed fourth down conversion. After a Patriots punt, the Steelers ran the ball three times to give the Patriots their 13th win of the season; with the win, the Patriots improved to 13-0 and also clinched a first-round playoff bye.\nQuestion: How many losses do the Steelers have before the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3, \n\nPassage: The 49ers featured one of the best running games in the NFL in 1976 NFL season. Delvin Williams emerged as an elite back, gaining over 1,200 yards rushing and made the Pro Bowl. Wilbur Jackson also enjoyed a resurgence, rushing for 792 yards. Once again Gene Washington was the teams leading receiver with 457 yards receiving and six scores. The 49ers started the season 6\u20131 for their best start since 1970. Most of the wins were against second-tier teams, although the 49ers did shut out the Rams 16\u20130, in 1976 Los Angeles Rams season on Monday Night Football. In that game the 49ers recorded 10 sacks, including 6 by Tommy Hart. However, the 49ers lost four games in a row, including two against divisional rivals Los Angeles and 1976 Atlanta Falcons season that proved fatal to their playoff hopes. Louis G. Spadia retired from the 49ers in 1977 upon the teams sale to the DeBartolo Family. The team was sold to Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. in March 1977, and despite finishing the season with a winning record of 8\u20136, Clark was fired after just one season by newly hired general manager Joe Thomas (American football executive), who oversaw the worst stretch of football in the teams history.\nQuestion: How many total games did the 49ers play in the 1976 season?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 14, \n\nPassage: Coming off of the bye week, the Steelers traveled to Baltimore to take on their division rival Ravens. The game received much hype, including QB Ben Roethlisberger returning from injury. Through the first half it was all Ravens when Joe Flacco found Mike Wallace on a 95-yard touchdown pass to move up 7-0 in the first quarter. This was followed by Justin Tucker's 49-yard field goal in the second to make it 10-0 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Ravens went back to work as Tucker went for a 42-yard field goal to make it 13-0. In the fourth quarter, Chris Moore blocked a punt and returned it 14 yards for a touchdown with a (successful two-point conversion) to make it 21-0. Later on in the game, the Steelers finally got on the board as Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 23-yard touchdown pass making the score 21-7. They wrapped up the scoring later on when Roethlisberger ran for a touchdown himself from 4 yards out making the final score 21-14. With their third straight loss, the Steelers fell to 4-4 and move into a tie with the Ravens for the lead in the AFC North. The loss was also the Steelers' fourth straight loss to the Ravens as well as the fourth straight year losing to their top division rivals in Baltimore.\nQuestion: Which was longer Tucker's field goal or Wallace's touchdown pass?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Wallace on a 95-yard touchdown, \n\nPassage:  Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007.

Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins. They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover.",

                    "Passage: 2000 Based on the 2000 United States Census, there were 242,820 people, 98,782 households, and 59,269 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,619.7 people per square mile (625.4/km2). There were 111,927 housing units at an average density of 746.6 per square mile (288.3/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 62.46% African American, 35.07% White American, 0.17% Indigenous peoples of the Americas, 0.80% Asian American, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 0.62% from Race (United States Census), and 0.83% from Multiracial American. 1.55% of the population were Hispanic or Latino American of any race.\nQuestion: How many in percent from the census weren't Asian American?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 99.2\n\nPassage: After their win against the Baltimore Ravens 19-17, the Packers, wearing their throwback jerseys of blue and yellow, returned home to Lambeau Field to take on the Cleveland Browns. Both James Jones and Randall Cobb would be inactive for the game, and Jarrett Boykin got his first career start. He had a breakout game, catching 8 passes for 103 yards and 1 TD. After forcing the Browns to punt on their opening possession, the Packers quickly struck with a 10-yard TD pass to Jermichael Finley. After Brandon Weeden's pass was intercepted by Davon House on the next drive, the Packers took advantage with a 1-yard TD run by Eddie Lacy to take a 14-0 lead in the 1st quarter. After Cleveland scored on a 46-yard field goal, the Packers responded with a 26-yard field goal to take a 17-3 lead at halftime. In the 3rd quarter, the Browns scored on a 44-yard field goal to make it 17-6. Early in the 4th quarter, the Browns decided to go for it on 4th down and 15 on the Packers 31-yard line. The pass to Jordan Cameron in the endzone was incomplete, and the Packers took over. On the drive, Jermichael Finley was carried off the field on a stretcher after suffering a neck injury. The Packers capped off that drive with a 1-yard TD pass to Jordy Nelson. They followed it up with a 20-yard TD pass to Jarrett Boykin, taking a 31-13 win. About two weeks after the game, Jermichael Finley was put on IR. With the win, the Packers extend their winning streak to 3, and improve to 4-2.\nQuestion: How many less was the 26 yards goal compared to the 44 yards goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 18, \n\nPassage: Coming off their Sunday night divisional road win over the Eagles, the Cowboys flew to Giants Stadium for an NFC East rematch with the New York Giants. In the first quarter, Dallas shot first as QB Tony Romo completed a 15-yard TD pass to TE Tony Curtis.  Afterwards, the Giants responded with QB Eli Manning completing an 8-yard TD pass to TE Jeremy Shockey. In the second quarter, the Cowboys retook the lead as rookie kicker Nick Folk got a 44-yard field goal, yet New York answered with RB Reuben Droughns getting a 1-yard TD run.  Dallas reclaimed the lead with Romo completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.  However, due to a taunting penalty on LB Kevin Burnett, the Giants were given great field position to get some points prior to halftime.  The Cowboys held New York to a 40-yard Lawrence Tynes field goal. In the third quarter, Dallas regained the lead with Romo completing a 25-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Giants only got a 26-yard field goal from Tynes.  Afterwards, the Cowboys completed the season-sweep with Romo and Owens hooking up again on a 50-yard TD pass. This would mark the first time since their Super Bowl year of 1995 that the Cowboys began a season at 8-1, and only the third time in franchise history that Dallas began at 8-1; the other times were during the 1977 season, and the 1983 season.  The Cowboys won the Super Bowl in 1977 and 1995, but lost the wildcard game to the Los Angeles Rams in 1983. For their season-sweep over New York, Dallas had scored a total of 76 points in the two meetings. DT Tank Johnson, in his first game with the Cowboys (along with the first game off of his suspension), recorded 3 tackles and a sack.\nQuestion: Which team scored the least points?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Giants, \n\nPassage:  Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007.

                    "Passage: Philip IV of France became King in 1285, and was determined to strengthen the French monarchy at any cost. The County of Flanders had been formally part of the French Kingdom since the Treaty of Verdun in 843, but had always de facto been largely, if not fully, independent from the French crown. Flanders had some of the richest cities of that time, like Bruges, Ghent, Ypres, Lille and Douai. These cities tried to keep their independence from the Count of Flanders and from the rural aristocracy. But the cities were themselves divided between the rich patricians and the urban tradesmen, united in guilds. In 1288, Philip IV of France used complaints over taxes to tighten his control over Flanders. Tension built between Guy of Dampierre, Count of Flanders and the King. In 1294, Guy turned for help to King Edward I of England, arranging a marriage between his daughter Philippa and Edward, Prince of Wales. However, Philip imprisoned Guy and two of his sons, forced him to call off the marriage, and imprisoned Philippa in Paris until her death in 1306. Guy was summoned before the king again in 1296, and the principal cities of Flanders were taken under royal protection, until Guy paid an indemnity and surrendered his territories, to hold them at the grace of the King. After these indignities, in 1297 Guy attempted to revenge himself on Philip by an alliance with Edward I of England, now at war with France. Philip responded by declaring Flanders annexed to the royal domain and sending a French army under Robert II of Artois to conquer Flanders.\nQuestion: How many years after Philippa was imprisoned did she die?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 12\n\nPassage: The cause of the conflicts was like many of the Indian Wars. In 1684, the Spanish colonists in the present day Mexican state of Sonora discovered silver in the Rio Yaqui Valley. Following this, the Spanish gradually began settling on Yaqui land, and by 1740, the natives were ready to resist. Some minor conflicts from before dated back to 1533 but in 1740 the Yaqui united with the neighboring Mayo, Opata, and Pima tribes and successfully drove the colonists out by 1742.\nQuestion: what tribes worked together to successfully drove the colonists out?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Yaqui, Mayo, Opata, Pima, \n\nPassage: The Giants' defense was trashed by the media during Week 4, their bye week, as they had allowed a whopping 92 points in their first three games, roughly 31 per game. After forcing a punt, the Giants drove to the Washington 29, but Jay Feely was wide left on a 47-yard attempt. Aided by a William Joseph roughing-the-passer penalty on 3rd-and-11 that would have forced a Washington punt, Mark Brunell drove the Redskins to the Giants' 21, where John Hall nailed a 39-yard field goal. Manning was unfazed, finding Amani Toomer on a 44-yard completion to move the ball to the Washington 10, and apparently finding him for a touchdown pass of 5 yards three plays later, but the score was nullified by a Jeremy Shockey pass-interference penalty. Feely knocked in a chip shot of 24 yards to tie the score, 3-3, early in the second quarter. Manning would again use the big play to help the Giants to their next score, finding Plaxico Burress on a 46-yard completion that gave the Giants the ball at the Redskins' 22. Soon after, Feely hit a 34-yard field goal to give the Giants their first lead since Week 2. After forcing a punt, Manning led the Giants on a 14-play, 84-yard drive, capped by a 32-yard field goal by Feely, his third of the quarter and half. The Giants' offense finally ground into gear on the first possession of the second half, going on a 15-play, 69-yard drive that ate up 8:05 of the clock, capped by a 2-yard touchdown toss from Manning to Burress. The Redskins could muster only one scoring opportunity the rest of the way (Hall missed a 42-yard field goal wide left the possession after Burress' touchdown), and Feely added a 40-yard field goal with 2:58 to play, capping the scoring.\nQuestion: Who put them in the lead?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Feely, \n\nPassage:  Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007.

On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins. They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover.\nQuestion: How many points were scored in the first half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: Gaozong promoted Qin Hui in 1138 and put him in charge of deliberations with the Jin. Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and a large number of officials at court criticized the peace overtures. Aided by his control of the Censorate, Qin purged his enemies and continued negotiations. In 1138 the Jin and Song agreed to a treaty that designated the Yellow River as border between the two states and recognized Gaozong as a \"subject\" of the Jin. But because there remained opposition to the treaty in both the courts of the Jin and Song, the treaty never came into effect. A Jurchen army led by Wuzhu invaded in early 1140. The Song counteroffensive that followed achieved large territorial gains. Song general Liu Qi  won a battle against Wuzhu at Shunchang . Yue Fei was assigned to head the Song forces defending the Huainan region. Instead of advancing to Huainan, however, Wuzhu retreated to Kaifeng and Yue's army followed him into Jin territory, disobeying an order by Gaozong that forbade Yue from going on the offensive. Yue captured Zhengzhou and sent soldiers across the Yellow River to stir up a peasant rebellion against the Jin. On July 8, 1140, at the Battle of Yancheng, Wuzhu launched a surprise attack on Song forces with an army of 100,000 infantry and 15,000 horsemen. Yue Fei directed his cavalry to attack the Jurchen soldiers and won a decisive victory. He continued on to Henan, where he recaptured Zhengzhou and Luoyang. Later in 1140, Yue was forced to withdraw after the emperor ordered him to return to the Song court.\nQuestion: Who signed a treaty?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: the Jin and Song, \n\nPassage: After a tough win over the Texans, the Steelers stayed home for a game against the Colts.  In the first quarter, the Colts scored first as Adam Vinatieri nailed a 31-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead.  However, the Steelers took the lead later on in the quarter when Ben Roethlisberger found Markus Wheaton on an 18-yard TD pass for a 7-3 game.  In the 2nd quarter, the Steelers would score again increasing their lead as Roethlisberger found Martavis Bryant on a 5-yard TD pass for a 14-3 game.  This was followed by William Gay picking off Andrew Luck and returning it 33 yards for a TD as they increased their lead to 21-3.  The Colts however responded as Andrew Luck threw a 21-yard TD pass to Dwayne Allen for a 21-10 game.  However, the Steelers pulled away as Roethlisberger would find Antonio Brown on 2 consecutive TD passes:  from 8 and 47 yards out to increase their lead at first from 28-10 to 35-10.  The Colts responded with 10 straight points first being Luck who found T. Y. Hilton on a 28-yard TD Pass for a 35-17 game followed by Vinatieri kicking a 23-yard field goal before halftime to make the score 35-20.  The Steelers went back to work in the 3rd quarter as Roethlisberger and Bryant hooked up again on a 2-yard TD pass to increase their lead making the score 42-20.  The Colts however were able to come within 8 later on when Ahmad Bradshaw ran for a 12-yard TD followed by Luck finding Donte Moncrief on a 31-yard TD pass to make the score 42-27 and then 42-34.  In the 4th quarter, it was all Steelers when a penalty was enforced on Luck in the end zone for a safety making the score 44-34.  The Steelers were able to seal the game later on when Roethlisberger found Heath Miller on an 11-yard TD pass for a final score of 51-34. Roethlisberger set franchise records with 522 yards passing and six touchdowns while picking up his 100th victory in his 150th start. Roethlisberger's yardage total was the fourth highest in NFL history. He became the first player in NFL history to go over 500 yards passing twice as the Steelers won consecutive games for the first time this season.\nQuestion: How many touchdowns were scored in the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 11, \n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Titans, the Chiefs flew to The Meadowlands for a Week 8 duel with the New York Jets.  Due to the season-ending injuries to QB's Brodie Croyle and Damon Huard, Tyler Thigpen made his second career start. Thigpen became the starting quarterback by default. In the first quarter, Kansas City trailed early as Jets QB Brett Favre completed an 18-yard TD pass to RB Leon Washington.  In the second quarter, the Chiefs tied the game as Thigpen completed a 19-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez.  New York responded with Washington getting a 60-yard TD run, yet Kansas City closed out the half with Thigpen completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR Mark Bradley. In the third quarter, the Chiefs took the lead as rookie kicker Connor Barth nailed a 30-yard field goal, yet the Jets regained the lead with RB Thomas Jones getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Kansas City took the lead again as rookie CB Brandon Flowers returned an interception 91&#160;yards for a touchdown.  However, New York got the last laugh as Favre completed a 15-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles.\nQuestion: How many yards was the second longest scoring play?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 60\n\nPassage:  Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007.

                    "Passage: The start of the war in Europe is generally held to be 1 September 1939, beginning with the German invasion of Poland; the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany two days later. The dates for the beginning of war in the Pacific include the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War on 7 July 1937, or even the Japanese invasion of Manchuria on 19 September 1931. Others follow the British historian A. J. P. Taylor, who held that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars merged in 1941. This article uses the conventional dating. Other starting dates sometimes used for World War\u00a0II include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935. The British historian Antony Beevor views the beginning of World War II as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to September 1939. The exact date of the war's end is also not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 14 August 1945 , rather than the formal surrender of Japan, which was on 2 September 1945 that officially ended the war in Asia. A peace treaty with Japan was signed in 1951. A treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place in 1990 and resolved most post-World War II issues. A formal peace treaty between Japan and the USSR had never been signed.\nQuestion: What was the date that the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3 September 1936, \n\nPassage: After a tough road loss to the Ravens, the Browns went to face against the Giants on the road. They drew first blood taking a 7-0 lead as Trent Richardson ran for a 15-yard touchdown followed by Brandon Weeden finding Josh Gordon on a 62-yard touchdown pass leaving the Browns with a 14-0 lead. Finally, the Giants were able to get on the board when Eli Manning found Victor Cruz on a 3-yard pass to shorten the lead 14-7. In the 2nd quarter, the Browns moved ahead by double digits again as Phil Dawson kicked a 32-yard field goal for a 17-7. The Giants then again responded by scoring 17 unanswered points before halftime starting by coming within a touchdown off of Lawrence Tynes' 29-yard field goal making the score 17-10. Then the Giants were able to tie it as Ahmad Bradshaw ran for a 4-yard touchdown for a 17-17 score before the Giants took the lead as Manning found Cruz again on a 7-yard pass making the score 24-17. Tynes made the score 27-17 with a 40-yard field goal not long before halftime. The Giants went right back to work in the third quarter as Manning found Cruz a 3rd time on a 28-yard pass increasing their lead to 34-17. Then the Browns tried to rally a comeback but only came away with Dawson nailing a 41-yard field goal making the score 34-20. Then in the fourth quarter, David Wilson ran for a 40-yard touchdown making the score 41-20. The Browns wrapped up the game scoring with Weeden finding Gordon again on a 20-yard pass for a final score of 41-27. The Browns dropped to 0-5 on the season. And with the Saints' win over the Chargers on Sunday Night, they remain the league's only winless team.\nQuestion: Who scored first?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: the Browns, \n\nPassage: The Bills began their 2008 campaign at home against the Seattle Seahawks.  In the first quarter, Buffalo drew first blood as running back Marshawn Lynch got a 21-yard touchdown run.  In the second quarter, the Bills increased their lead with wide receiver/punt returner Roscoe Parrish returning a punt 63 yards for a touchdown.  The Seahawks responded with quarterback Matt Hasselbeck completing a 20-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Nate Burleson.  Buffalo closed out the half with kicker Rian Lindell getting a 35-yard and a 38-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, Seattle responded with kicker Olindo Mare nailing a 45-yard field goal.  Afterwards, Buffalo dug into their bag of tricks. Appearing to attempt a 32-yard field goal, holder Brian Moorman completed a 19-yard touchdown pass to defensive end Ryan Denney.  The Bills pulled away with quarterback Trent Edwards completing a 30-yard touchdown pass to tight end Robert Royal. With this win, the Bills started their season with a 1-0 record.\nQuestion: How many yards did Parrish return a punt?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 63\n\nPassage:  Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007. After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins. They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover.\nQuestion: How many points did Detroit win by?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: The Bears opened the season at home against the Buffalo Bills, who had a record of 6-10 in 2013. Entering the game, the Bears were 54-35-5 in season openers, the most wins of any team, and they had not lost an opening game since 2009, the most in the NFC and second-most in the NFL behind the New England Patriots. The Bears were 7-4 against the Bills, with their last meeting being a 22-19 victory in Toronto in 2010, while winning 40-7 in the last game between the two at Soldier Field; the Bears had won all five meetings between the two in Chicago. When comparing the two teams in 2013 statistically, the Bears had the advantage in three offensive categories (points scored, total offense, and passing offense), while the Bills had the second-best rushing offense, compared to the Bears' 16th-ranked rushing game. On defense, the Bears were outmatched in all three categories (total defense, rushing defense, and passing defense), but are one spot higher than Buffalo in turnover ratio (+5 to +3). Scout.com's Jeremy Stoltz writes that one of the players the Bears must contain is the defensive tackle duo of Mario Williams and Marcell Dareus, who had a combined 139 total tackles, 18.0 sacks and two forced fumbles during 2013. While the Bears' offensive line boasted the fourth-least sacks, none of the five starters played in the preseason. As a result, to combat the rush, the Bears need Jay Cutler to release the ball quickly. For the Bears' defense, Stoltz stated all the Bears needed to do was stop Buffalo's running backs Fred Jackson and C. J. Spiller, as the Bills had the second-best rushing attack in the league. The Bears were favored to win by seven points, the third-largest spread of the week. Matt Fort&#233;, Charles Tillman, and Robbie Gould were the captains for the game. David Fales, Kelvin Hayden, Tony Fiammetta, Khaseem Greene, Charles Leno, Jr., David Bass and Cornelius Washington were inactive for the game. The Bears won the coin toss, and elected to kick. After Buffalo punted, Chicago scored on Cutler's 12-yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett, which the Bills retaliated with E. J. Manuel's two-yard touchdown run. On the Bears' first drive of the second quarter, Brandon Marshall fumbled, with linebacker Preston Brown recovering; the Bills would score on Dan Carpenter's 50-yard field goal. Afterwards, Cutler was intercepted by former Bear Corey Graham after Bennett did not \"turn to look for the ball in time\", with the Bills again capitalizing on the takeaway, with Manuel's seven-yard touchdown pass to Spiller, and the half ended with Buffalo leading 17-7. On the Bears' first possession of the third quarter, Gould kicked a five-yard field goal, and on the Bills' first drive of the half, Chris Conte read a pass intended for Marquise Goodwin, stepping in front of the pass to intercept the ball. On Chicago's ensuing drive, the offense rallied to tie the score on Cutler's 11-yard touchdown pass to Marshall. In the fourth quarter, the Bears drove from their own six-yard line to reach the Buffalo 34, but Cutler's forced pass intended for Bennett was intercepted by Kyle Williams; Carpenter would kick a 33-yard field goal, which the Bears responded with Gould's 37-yarder. The Bills would kneel to end regulation with a 20-20 score. After the Bears went three-and-out, the Bills started on their own 22-yard line, but drove to the Bears' 39. On the next play, Jackson found a hole in the line of scrimmage, getting past Lance Briggs. Conte reached Jackson at the 20-yard line, but was stiff-armed; Conte attempted to tackle again, but was knocked down, with Jackson being pushed out of bounds at the one-yard line. Two plays later, Carpenter kicked the game-winning 27-yard field goal. Four of the Bears' offensive starters suffered injuries during the game: Roberto Garza (right ankle) and Matt Slauson (left ankle) did not play after the first half, Alshon Jeffery (hamstring) departed in the third quarter, while Marshall (right ankle) was hurt after being tackled. Conte received scrutiny after the game for failing to tackle Jackson, but defended himself by saying, \"It was a play where it's the end of the game - I've got to get the ball out or something. If I hit him, it's a field goal no matter what, so I've got to try and get the ball out. It's a desperation play where I've got to try and punch the ball or something.\"\nQuestion: How many yards was the shortest field goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 27\n\nPassage: The U.S. Census Bureaus 2007\u20132011 American Community Survey indicated the median household income for Indianapolis city was $42,704, and the median family income was $53,161.

Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins. They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover.",

The Lions took an early lead in the 1st quarter with a 10-yard TD catch by Nate Burleson. Tampa Bay tied it up in the second quarter with a 24-yard TD catch by Mike Williams, and later took the lead with a 39-yard TD run by LeGarrette Blount. The Lions answered just before halftime with a 41-yard field goal. The only score of the 3rd quarter was a 10-yard TD run by Maurice Morris of the Lions. Tampa Bay had 2 field goals in the fourth quarter, from 30 then 26 yards out. The Lions tied the game just before the end of regulation with a 28-yard field goal, taking it to overtime. In overtime the Lions got the ball first and kicked a 34-yard field goal for the win. With the win not only did the Lions improve to 4-10, but it broke their record 26-game road losing streak. It was also their first back to back wins since 2007.\nQuestion: how many yards did tie with in the second?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 24, \n\nPassage: Coming off their win over the Redskins and subsequent bye week, the Broncos traveled to Qualcomm Stadium for an AFC West duel with the San Diego Chargers. A 74-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to tight end Julius Thomas in the first quarter gave the Broncos the early lead. Two second-quarter field goals by Chargers' placekicker Nick Novak &#8212; from 26 and 40 yards out &#8212; narrowed the Broncos lead. However, the Broncos struck back, with Manning connecting on three touchdown passes to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas &#8212; an 11-yarder, a 7-yarder just before halftime and a 34-yarder on the opening possession of the second half, which increased the Broncos' lead to 28-6. On the Broncos' next possession, Chargers' linebacker Tourek Williams forced a fumble off Manning deep in Broncos' territory, and the Chargers immediately capitalized two plays later, with quarterback Philip Rivers throwing a 7-yard touchdown pass to running back Danny Woodhead. The Chargers further narrowed the Broncos' lead early in the fourth quarter, with running back Ryan Mathews rushing for a 1-yard touchdown to pull to within 28-20 with 10:44 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Chargers' defense forced a punt on the Broncos' next possession, and with 6:43 left in the game, the Chargers tried to rally, however, the Broncos' defense forced a Chargers' punt with 3:37 remaining, and the Broncos' offense subsequently ran out the clock.\nQuestion: Which player scored first in the second half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Demaryius Thomas\n\nPassage: In 2006, Household income in the United States was $43,318 per household ($26,000 per household member) with 42% of households having two income earners.

A contemporary chronicler gave a lower estimate of 4,000 knights and an unknown amount of infantry. German historian Claudia Naumann suggested in 1994 that the Crusade had 16,000 men, including 3,000 knights.Bretislaus III, Duke of Bohemia had agreed to join the Crusade at the Diet in Worms on December 1195, and planned to do so, until he fell ill and died on 15 or 19 June 1197. In March 1197 Henry proceeded to the Kingdom of Sicily. The crusaders embarked for Acre, while the emperor first had to suppress an armed revolt in Catania. A force of 3,000 Saxon and Rhenish troops in 44 ships under Count Palatine Henry V and Archbishop Hartwig of Bremen sailed from northern Germany and arrived in Messina in August, where they merged with the emperor's troops and sailed to the Eastern Mediterranean. Still in Sicily, out for hunting near Fiumedinisi in August, Emperor Henry fell ill with chills, possibly from malaria. He died on September 28 before he could set sail for the Holy Land.\nQuestion: How many years after the Duke of Bohemia agreed to join the Crusade at the Diet in Worms did he die?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2, \n\nPassage:  Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007.

Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins. They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover.\nQuestion: Which player scored the first touchdown of the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: In 1915, during World War I, British and South African forces occupied it in the so-called South West Africa Campaign, and SW Africa later became a protectorate of South Africa. On 16 August 2004, 100 years after the war, the German government officially apologized for the atrocities. \"We Germans accept our historic and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by Germans at that time,\" said Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, Germany's development aid minister. In addition, she admitted that the massacres were equivalent to genocide. Not until 2015 did the German government admit that the massacres were equivalent to genocide and again apologized in 2016. The Herero are suing the German government in a class action lawsuit.\nQuestion: How many years did it take after the Germans apologized for them to admit that the massacres were equivalent to genocide?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 11, \n\nPassage:  This game was played in the shadow of the death of WR Torrey Smith's brother, who had died in a motorcycle crash the night before. The Ravens entered the game hoping to be able to avenge the AFC Championship loss of the previous season, which came at the hands of the Patriots.  New England started off fast as they drew to a 13-0 lead in the first quarter. However Baltimore scored 2 straight touchdowns to take the lead with 1:47 left to go in the half. Then Brady scored a touchdown right at the end of the half to retake the lead 20-14. The second half started off with a touchdown pass from Flacco to Dennis Pitta to put the Ravens on top 21-20. Then the Patriots retook the lead when Tom Brady scored a touchdown. After that the Baltimore defense began to step it up and held the Pats to a field goal. Then the momentum shifted as Baltimore scored a touchdown (Flacco to Torrey Smith). After forcing a Patriots punt, the Ravens drove down the field to score a field goal as time expired to win the game 31-30. The Ravens avenged the AFC Championship loss and improved to 2-1 and continued their unbeaten record at home from the previous year along with continuing their streak of winning after a loss. Based on Torrey Smith's performance through personal hardship, this game was ranked #9 on NFL.com's Top 20 NFL Games of 2012 as Showing Up. Smith finishes with six receptions for 127 yards and two touchdowns. This game was also remembered for 2 controversial incidents. Late in the 4th quarter, with New England leading 30-28, coach John Harbaugh was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct for coming out onto the field, which by NFL rules, is prohibited. However, Harbaugh was claiming that he was trying to only call a timeout to save time for his team. Since the NFL was using replacement refs at the time, and not the original refs, this was another controversial incident involving replacement refs. The penalty resulted in an irate Ravens crowd chanting the word \"Bullshit\" 3 separate times in just over a minute during the Patriots last drive, which was picked up by NBC microphones and was clearly audible during the broadcast. Play-by-play announcer Al Michaels said \"That's the loudest manuere chant I've ever heard\". The other controversy is the winning field goal by Tucker. The ball, after it had been kicked, sailed over the top of the right upright. It was ruled \"good\", giving Baltimore the win. However, clear replays show that the ball was awfully close to sailing wide of the upright, which would've resulted in the kick being no good and giving the Patriots the win. Since field goals are not reviewable, the play could not be reviewed. Patriots coach Bill Belichick, as he was leaving the field, grabbed one of the officials, resulting in him being fined $50,000 by the NFL.\nQuestion: How many points were the patriots leading by at the end of the first half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 6\n\nPassage: The Browns were a Vegas road favorite for the first time since 2012 and an overall favorite for the first time since 2015.  The Colts drew first blood in the first quarter when backup QB Jacoby Brissett ran for a 5-yard touchdown to make the score 7-0 for the quarter's only points.  The Browns managed to tie it up in the second quarter when Duke Johnson Jr. ran for a 19-yard touchdown to make it 7-7.  Though the Colts then responded with 3 straight touchdowns:  Brissett ran for another one from 7 yards out followed up by a 61-yard passing touchdown from him to T.Y. Hilton.  Lastly, the Frank Gore ran for a 4-yard touchdown for lead changes of 14-7, 21-7, and 28-7.  The Browns managed to make the score 28-14 at halftime when DeShone Kizer found David Njoku on a 1-yard pass.  After a scoreless third quarter, the Colts managed to increase their lead when Adam Vinatieri nailed a 33-yard field goal to make it 31-14.  The Browns tried to rally with 2 more touchdowns:  Kizer connected with Kenny Britt on an 11-yard pass to make it 31-21.  This would be followed up by Kizer running in for a touchdown himself from a yard out to make it 31-28.  The Browns failed to recover the onside kick and it sealed the win for the Colts.  With the loss, the Browns fell to 0-3. The team also lost their 15th straight road game.\nQuestion: How many losses in a row do the Browns now have?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 15, \n\nPassage: In 1085, Guadalajara was retaken by the Christian forces of Alfonso VI .

                    "Passage: In the following years, the L\u00fcneburg countryside was devastated by numerous battles and campaigns. These, however, were only partly due to the succession conflict - in addition there was wanton arson and looting by robber barons. In addition to the Ascanians and the Welfs, foreign towns and princes were increasingly involved as allies. Thus Magnus entered into a military alliance with the Danish king. In 1373, at an specially arranged meeting in Pirna, an imperial mediation attempt took place. Since Magnus did not appear, however, the Imperial Ban against him was renewed and fighting continued. In 1373, Duke Magnus was killed in a battle at Leveste on the Deister on 25 July 1373. After his death, a treaty - the Reconciliation of Hanover - was agreed between Wenceslas and his nephew Albert, on the one hand, and the widow of Magnus II and her sons on the other. According to the treaty, the estates of the Principality were to pay homage both to the Welfs and to the Ascanians, and the two noble houses would govern the state alternately. Initially, the land would be given to the two Ascanians from Wittenberg, and after their death it would go to the sons of the fallen Duke Magnus II. After their death, rule of the Principality was to revert to the Ascanians. In order to underpin the agreement, in 1374 Albert of Saxe-L\u00fcneburg married Catharina, the widow of Magnus II. The two still underage sons were also married in 1386 to members of the Ascanian house. Frederick of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg married Anna of Saxe-Wittenberg and Bernard of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg married Margareta of Saxony, both women were daughters of Wenceslas. The treaty also envisaged the creation of a statutory body representing the estates, which was to supervise the treaty.\nQuestion: Who was married first Albert of Saxe-L\u00fcneburg married Catharina or the two still underage sons?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Albert of Saxe-L\u00fcneburg married Catharina, \n\nPassage: The Ravens began their 2008 campaign at home against their toughest AFC North foe, the Cincinnati Bengals.  In the first quarter, Baltimore opened the scoring with WR Mark Clayton scoring on a 42-yard TD run from a double-reverse play.  In the second quarter, the Ravens increased their advantage with Matt Stover kicking a 21-yard field goal.  The Bengals responded with Shayne Graham kicking a 43-yard field goal to end the first half.  In the third quarter, Baltimore responded with rookie quarterback Joe Flacco scoring on a 38-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Cincinnati tried to rally as CB Johnathan Joseph returned a fumble 65 yards for a touchdown.  Ultimately, the Ravens defense stopped a potential Bengals scoring drive on fourth down late in the fourth quarter and won the game. Joe Flacco in his rookie debut, completed 15 of 29 passes for 129 yards (along with a touchdown run).\nQuestion: Which players had touchdown runs?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Mark Clayton, Joe Flacco\n\nPassage: Henry XVI already had a dispute with Louis VII's father Stephen III. On 17 April 1414, Henry and other enemies of Louis VII founded the Parakeet Society.  On 8 July 1415, the society was changed into the League of Constance, an alliance for mutual defense against Louis VII.  In 1417 in Constance, Louis insulted Henry by calling him \"the son of a cook\". When Louis then accused Henry of having shed human blood, Henry and fifteen of his followers physically attacked Louis and injured him severely. After this attack, Louis described Henry as a pluethunt , which did little to defuse the conflict. Henry XVI evaded punishment for the attack on Louis VII only through the intercession of Frederick of Brandenburg and his cousins Dukes Ernest and William III in Munich and especially by paying 6000 guilders to King Sigismund.  Henry XVI wanted revenge. The conflict escalated into a war when an army from Bavaria-Ingolstadt burned down the castle of the Burgrave of Nuremberg. John III, who had succeeded his brother William II as Duke of Bavaria-Straubing in 1418, remained neutral.\nQuestion: What was the former name of the League of Constance?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Parakeet Society, \n\nPassage: In 1085, Guadalajara was retaken by the Christian forces of Alfonso VI .

                    "Passage: Cincinnati had a number of offensive weapons, boasting six Pro Bowl selections. Wide receiver Eddie Brown (wide receiver) was the top receiver on the team, with 54 receptions for 1,273 yards and 9 touchdowns, setting franchise records for most receiving yards in season, highest yards per catch average in a season (24.0) and most receiving yards in a single game (216 against the Pittsburgh Steelers). Wide receiver Tim McGee and Pro Bowl tight end Rodney Holman were also major threats, combining for 75 receptions, 1,213 yards, and 9 touchdowns. Rookie fullback Ickey Woods was their top rusher with 1,066 yards and 15 touchdowns, while also catching 21 passes for 199 yards and gaining a lot of media attention with his \"Ickey Shuffle\", a dance routine he did in the end zone to celebrate his touchdowns. Multi-talented running back James Brooks (American football player) was also a key contributor, gaining a total of 1,218 combined rushing and receiving yards and 14 touchdowns. And the Bengals offensive line was led by such Pro Bowl players as right guard Max Montoya and left tackle Anthony Mu\u00f1oz. Mu\u00f1oz was named the NFL Offensive Lineman of the Year for the third time in his career, and was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the 8th season in a row. With all these weapons, Cincinnatis offense led the NFL in scoring (448 points), rushing yards (2,710), and total yards (6,302).\nQuestion: Who scored more touchdowns, Tim McGee and Rodney Holman or Ickey Woods?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Ickey Woods\n\nPassage: Hoping to get their first win of the year, the Titans traveled to the RCA Dome for Week 5, as they played an AFC South match-up with the Indianapolis Colts.  The Titans got off to a surprising start, as QB Vince Young ran 19 yards for a touchdown.  Tennessee would follow it up in the second quarter, as kicker Rob Bironas kicked a 22-yard field goal to give the Titans a 10-0 halftime lead.  In the third quarter, Tennessee would get an unpleasant wake-up call, as Colts QB Peyton Manning completed a 13-yard TD pass to WR Marvin Harrison.  The Titans would get another field goal, as Bironas kicked a 47-yard field goal.  Unfortunately, Tennessee remained winless on the year, as Manning completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne in the fourth quarter.  With their loss, the Titans continued to stay at the bottom of the AFC South.  With the loss, the Titans dropped to 0-5.\nQuestion: How many points did the Titans score in the first half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 10, \n\nPassage: Reid and Saajid Badat, another British man preparing as a terrorist, returned to Pakistan in November 2001, and reportedly travelled overland to Afghanistan. They were given \"shoe bombs\", casual footwear adapted to be covertly smuggled onto aircraft before being used to destroy them. Later forensic analysis of both bombs showed that they contained the same plastic explosive and that the respective lengths of detonator cord had come from the same batch: the cut mark on Badat's cord exactly matched that on Reid's. The pair returned separately to the United Kingdom in early December 2001. Reid went to Belgium for 10 days before catching a train to Paris on 16 December. On 21 December 2001, Reid attempted to board a flight from Paris to Miami, Florida. His boarding was delayed because his dishevelled physical appearance aroused the suspicions of the airline passenger screeners. In addition, Reid did not answer all of their questions, and had not checked any luggage for the transatlantic flight. Additional screening by the French National Police resulted in Reid's being re-issued a ticket for a flight on the following day. He returned to the Paris airport on 22 December 2001, and boarded American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami, wearing his special shoes packed with plastic explosives in their hollowed-out bottoms.\nQuestion: How many days passed between Reid's arrival in Paris and his attempt to board a plane to Miami?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 5, \n\nPassage: In 1085, Guadalajara was retaken by the Christian forces of Alfonso VI .

According to the 1901 census, out of 711,988 inhabitants 56.2% were Catholics, 35.7% Jews, 5% Greek Orthodox Christians and 2.8% Protestants. Eight years later, in 1909, there were 281,754 Jews (36.9%), 18,189 Protestants (2.4%) and 2,818 Mariavite Church (0.4%). This led to construction of hundreds of places of religious worship in all parts of the town. Most of them were destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw uprising of 1944. After the war, the new communist authorities of Poland discouraged church construction and only a small number were rebuilt.\nQuestion: What was the second smallest religion in 1901 in Warsaw?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Greek Orthodox Christians\n\nPassage: The desire for a permanent connection across the Limfjord at Aggersund dates back to the early 1900s. In the mid-1920s, citizens in L\u00f8gst\u00f8r reduced a selection, which appeared with a number of suggestions for a bridge. However, the initiative stranded controversy about the alignment and funding. In 1936, the idea was resumed by the Ministry of Employment and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Transport as a possible employment measure, and in 1939 the construction of the bridge, which was funded by Aalborg, Hj\u00f8rring and Thisted Amter, began. The bridge was projected by Christen Ostenfeld. The initiation took place on 18 June 1942. The bridge cost about 3.5 million DKK. During the German occupation of Denmark, the bridge was strategically important for the German shipments of crew and equipment to and from Norway. Therefore, a military support point was built in 1943-44, consisting of 11 concrete plants on the north side and 6 on the south side. In addition, minefields and other types of barriers were introduced. Two large Flak bunkers on the south side and one on the north side are still available and are available. The other smaller bunkers have either been removed or located in a private area without public access. In 2000, the Aggersund Bridge beams were strengthened, increasing the carrying capacity of the bridge.

                    "Passage: Following their home win over the Chiefs, the Texans flew to Bank of America Stadium for their Week 2 match-up against the Carolina Panthers.  In the first quarter, Houston trailed early as QB Jake Delhomme hooked up with WR Steve Smith for a 7-yard and a 12-yard TD pass.  Houston would respond with QB Matt Schaub completing a 31-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson.  In the second quarter, Schaub and Johnson would hook up with each other again on a 9-yard TD pass.  The Texans would take the lead prior to halftime with kicker Kris Brown getting a 25-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Houston increased its lead with RB Ahman Green getting a 13-yard TD run.  On the following kickoff, Panthers FB Nick Goings would fumble the ball, causing it to roll into Carolina's end zone, where WR Kevin Walter would land on it for a touchdown, giving a huge momentum swing towards the Texans.  In the fourth quarter, Houston would out the game out of reach with Brown kicking a 33-yard field goal.  The Panthers would muster up one last score as Delhomme completed a pass to Smith, who would break off many Texans defenders and go 74 yards for a touchdown.  In the end, Houston would hold on to win.

In the fourth quarter, the Texans would take the lead and never look back as running back Ryan Moats got three touchdown runs of 11 yards (followed by quarterback Matt Schaub's 2-point conversion pass to wide receiver Andre Johnson), 1 yard, and 3 yards. With the loss, Buffalo went into their bye week at 3-5. Despite the loss, rookie safety Jairus Byrd once again had two interceptions.  He would become the first rookie and only the second player in NFL history to have three-straight multi-interception games.\nQuestion: How many wins did the Bills have coming into today?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2, \n\nPassage: The Free State government had started peace negotiations in early May, which broke down. The High Court of Justice in Ireland  ruled on 31 July 1923 that a state of war no longer existed, and consequently the internment of republicans, permitted under common law only in wartime, was now illegal. Without a formal peace, holding 13,000 prisoners and worried that fighting could break out again at any time, the government enacted two Public Safety  Acts on 1 and 3 August 1923, to permit continued internment and other measures. Thousands of Anti-Treaty IRA members  were arrested by the Free State forces in the weeks and months after the end of the war, when they had dumped their arms and returned home. On 27 August 1923, a general election was held, which Cumann na nGaedheal, the pro-Free State party, won with about 40% of the first-preference vote. The Republicans, represented by Sinn F\u00e9in, won about 27% of the vote. Many of their candidates and supporters were still imprisoned before, during and after the election. In October 1923, around 8,000 of the 12,000 Republican prisoners in Free State gaols went on a hunger strike. The strike lasted for 41 days and met little success . However, most of the women prisoners were released shortly thereafter and the hunger strike helped concentrate the Republican movement on the prisoners and their associated organisations. In July, de Valera had recognised the Republican political interests lay with the prisoners and went so far as to say:\nQuestion: How many days between the two Public Safety Acts passed in August 1923?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2, \n\nPassage: Greater Manchester is home to a diverse population and is a multicultural agglomeration with an ethnic minority population comprising 8.5% of the total population in 2001. In 2008, there were over 66 refugee nationalities in the county. At the 2001 UK census, 74.2% of Greater Manchesters residents were Christian, 5.0% Muslim, 0.9% Jewish, 0.7% Hindu, 0.2% Buddhist, and 0.1% Sikh. 11.4% had no religion, 0.2% had an alternative religion and 7.4% did not state their religion. This is similar to the rest of the country, although the proportions of Muslims and Jews are nearly twice the national average. It contains the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation, a large Ashkenazi Orthodox synagogue in North Manchester. Greater Manchester is covered by the Roman Catholic Dioceses of Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford and Roman Catholic Diocese of Shrewsbury, and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool. Most of Greater Manchester is part of the Anglican Diocese of Manchester, apart from Metropolitan Borough of Wigan which lies within the Anglican Diocese of Liverpool.\nQuestion: Which religions made up at least 4% more of the population than the Hindus?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Christian, Muslim\n\nPassage: In 1085, Guadalajara was retaken by the Christian forces of Alfonso VI . The chronicles say that the Christian army was led by Alvar Fanez de Minaya, one of the lieutenants  of El Cid. From 1085 until the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, the city suffered wars against the Almoravid and the Almohad Empires. In spite of the wars, the Christian population could definitely settle down in the area thanks to the repopulation with people from the North  who received their first fuero in 1133 from Alfonso VII.In 1219, the king Fernando III gave a new fuero to the city .During the reign of Alfonso X of Castile, the protection of the king allowed the city to develop its economy by protecting merchants and allowing markets.\nQuestion: How many years passed from when Guadalajara was retaken by the Christian forces of Alfonso VI  until the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: In the county, the population was spread out with 23.5% under the age of 18, 7.8% from 18 to 24, 28.5% from 25 to 44, 25.9% from 45 to 64, and 14.2% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 93.8 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.5 males.\nQuestion: Which age group is larger: under the age of 18 or 18 to 24?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: under the age of 18\n\nPassage: The Jets quickly drove downfield on their first possession, scoring their first touchdown in the first quarter all season. Chad Pennington found Jerricho Cotchery on a 28-yard completion and rookie running back Leon Washington picked up 23 yards on a sweep around end before Washington scored on a 5-yard touchdown run. On the Jets' next possession, Pennington fired a 44-yard touchdown pass to Justin McCareins, his first touchdown of the season, to open up a 14-0 lead. The Lions would get on the board early in the second quarter as Jon Kitna had big completions to Dan Campbell, Mike Furrey, and Roy Williams, the pass to Williams a 22-yard touchdown. But on the kickoff, Justin Miller returned the ball 56 yards inside Detroit territory, and after a pass from Pennington to Cotchery, Kevan Barlow scored on a 3-yard touchdown run. Kitna would get intercepted by Kerry Rhodes on the next possession, but Pennington would then get picked off by Terrence Holt at the Detroit 2-yard line to short-circuit a possible score. The Jets led 21-7 at halftime. Kitna would again get intercepted on the first possession of the second half, this time by Jonathan Vilma. But the drive went nowhere, and Detroit's next one, a 12-play, 83-yard drive, resulted in a 25-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. The Jets got that right back, as Pennington converted a couple of third downs during a drive that was capped by Mike Nugent's 33-yard field goal. Down fourteen points, Detroit halved New York's lead with Kitna finding Kevin Jones on a 9-yard touchdown pass on a drive where Kitna converted a critical 4th-and-11 pass to Mike Furrey. The Jets would come right back, with Washington scoring on a 16-yard touchdown run on a sweep around end. Detroit would not give up, as Kitna found Furrey on an 18-yard touchdown pass on a play that survived a Jets challenge. On that drive, Kitna again converted a fourth down to Furrey. But Detroit's ensuing onside kick failed, and the Jets ran out the clock.\nQuestion: Which quarterback was sacked more than 5-times?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Daunte Culpepper\n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Colts, the Broncos traveled to Nashville to face the Tennessee Titans at LP Field. After a scoreless first quarter, the Broncos took the lead in the second quarter, as quarterback Kyle Orton threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Eddie Royal. The Titans responded, with quarterback Vince Young throwing an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Kenny Britt. The Broncos would retake the lead, with a 36-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater, but The Titans replied, when placekicker Rob Bironas nailed an incredible 55-yard field goal just before halftime. In the third quarter, the Broncos took the lead again, with another 36-yard field goal by Prater, but Titans' wide receiver Marc Mariani returned the ensuing kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown, putting Tennessee ahead 17-13. Tennessee's lead was narrowed, with a 35-yard field goal by Prater, but was increased again with a 46-yard field goal by Bironas. In the fourth quarter, the Broncos pulled ahead, when Orton completed a 6-yard touchdown pass to running back Correll Buckhalter. After the Titans fumbled the ensuing kickoff, the Broncos increased their lead with 28 seconds remaining, with a 36-yard field goal by Prater. The Broncos' defense thwarted the Titans' final desperation drive of the game.\nQuestion: How many of the touchdowns were passing touchdowns?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3, \n\nPassage: In 1085, Guadalajara was retaken by the Christian forces of Alfonso VI .

                    "Passage: Still looking for their first win of the season, the Browns went home for a Week 4 AFC North duel with the Cincinnati Bengals in Round 1 of 2010's Battle of Ohio. Cleveland got the early lead in the first quarter as kicker Phil Dawson got a 30-yard field goal.  The Browns added onto their lead in the second quarter as quarterback Seneca Wallace completed a 24-yard touchdown pass to tight end Evan Moore.  The Bengals answered with kicker Mike Nugent's 24-yard field goal, followed by quarterback Carson Palmer finding wide receiver Terrell Owens on a 78-yard touchdown pass.  The Browns would close out the half with Dawson getting a 31-yard field goal after linebacker Scott Fujita blocked a Bengals field goal attempt. In the third quarter, Cleveland picked up right where they left off as running back Peyton Hillis got a 1-yard touchdown run, followed by Dawson's 22-yard field goal.  Afterwards, Cincinnati answered with Nugent making a 25-yard field goal.  The Bengals tried to rally in the fourth quarter as Palmer found running back Brian Leonard on a 3-yard touchdown pass, yet the defense prevented Cincinnati from getting any closer.\nQuestion: How many field goals longer than 26 yards were kicked by both kickers combined?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2, \n\nPassage: The Giants' winning streak came to an end in San Francisco but they once again had the game in doubt into the final minutes. Field goals comprised the first half scoring, with Lawrence Tynes hitting two and the 49ers' David Akers recording three. The Giants took their only lead in the third quarter as Eli Manning found Mario Manningham for 13 yards to complete an 84-yard drive. The 49ers recorded two touchdowns on a pass to Vernon Davis and a run by Kendall Hunter, while Manning hit Hakeem Nicks for a 32-yard touchdown late in the game. New York received the ball late in the game and drove inside the 49ers' red zone, but Manning's last pass was deflected at the line of scrimmage to preserve the San Francisco win. Manning threw for 311 yards and two touchdowns but also recorded two interceptions, while Alex Smith threw for 242 and the touchdown pass to Davis. Brandon Jacobs rushed for 55 yards to lead the runners while Victor Cruz's 84 yards was tops for the receivers.\nQuestion: Who scored first\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 49ers, \n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Panthers, the Bears played their Week 3 home opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who were led by former Bears QB Brian Griese. In the first quarter, Chicago got the early lead as kicker Robbie Gould got a 40-yard and a 43-yard field goal.  The Buccaneers would respond with Griese completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Ike Hilliard.  In the second quarter, Tampa Bay increased its lead with DE Gaines Adams returning an interception 45 yards for a touchdown.  The Bears closed out the half with Gould's 28-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Chicago took the lead with QB Kyle Orton completing a 6-yard TD pass to rookie RB Matt Fort&#233; (along with Orton's 2-point conversion pass to WR Brandon Lloyd).

                    "Passage: Coming off their bye week, the Giants went home, donned their alternate uniforms, and played  the Dallas Cowboys.  In the first quarter, New York trailed early as Cowboys QB Tony Romo completed a 15-yard TD pass to TE Tony Curtis.  The Giants responded as QB Eli Manning completed an 8-yard TD pass to TE Jeremy Shockey.  In the second quarter, Dallas regained the lead as kicker Nick Folk made a 44-yard field goal. The G-Men took the lead with RB Reuben Droughns getting a 1-yard TD run.  Afterwards, the Cowboys retook the lead with Romo completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.  Originally, the Giants were willing to be down by 3 at halftime.  However, because of a taunting penalty on Dallas LB Kevin Burnett placed them near midfield, New York went for some points.  The Giants would tie the game with kicker Lawrence Tynes getting a 40-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Romo completed a 25-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens and the Cowboys regained the lead.  In the fourth quarter, the Giants made a 26-yard field goal from Tynes.  Afterwards, Dallas' Romo and Owens hooked up with each other again on a 50-yard TD pass. During the season series against the Cowboys, the Giants pass defense allowed 8 passing touchdowns, despite only allowing 8 passing touchdowns from their previous opponents this year.\nQuestion: How many more touchdown passing yards did Tony Romo throw than Eli Manning?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 102\n\nPassage: The median age in the city was 35.1 years. 24.2% of residents were under the age of 18; 7.9% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 33.8% were from 25 to 44; 24.6% were from 45 to 64; and 9.5% were 65 years of age or older.

On the next possession, Denver managed to tie the score with a 55-yard field goal. Later in the second quarter, Denver made a 9-play drive, capped off by a field goal, and a 6-3 lead. Tampa Bay took over with 2:21 left in the half. Brian Griese drove the Buccaneers in 11 plays to the Denver 11-yard line. As time ran out in the half, Matt Bryant kicked another field goal, and the game was tied 6-6 at halftime. Tampa Bay took the second half kickoff, but was forced to punt. Josh Bidwell pinned the Broncos at their own 4-yard line. On the first play of the drive, however, Cutler connected with Tony Scheffler for 33 yards, and dug themselves out of the hole. The resulting good field possession allowed Denver to punt, and pin Tampa Bay at their own 11. Brian Griese threw an incompletion, and suffered an injured shoulder on the play. Jeff Garcia took over at quarterback. With a short field, Denver drove 47 yards on only five plays, and took the lead again with a 10-yard touchdown pass by Cutler. They followed up with a field goal early in the fourth quarter, and held a 16-6 lead. Late in the fourth quarter, Jeff Garcia drove the Buccaneers 90 yards in 13 plays. The drive was capped off with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Ike Hilliard. The touchdown trimmed the deficit to 16-13. Rather than an onside, Tampa Bay elected to squib kick, and Denver recovered. The Broncos managed two first downs, and ran out the clock to secure the victory.\nQuestion: How many field goals did Denver kick in the fourth quarter?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1\n\nPassage: In 1085, Guadalajara was retaken by the Christian forces of Alfonso VI . The chronicles say that the Christian army was led by Alvar Fanez de Minaya, one of the lieutenants  of El Cid. From 1085 until the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, the city suffered wars against the Almoravid and the Almohad Empires. In spite of the wars, the Christian population could definitely settle down in the area thanks to the repopulation with people from the North  who received their first fuero in 1133 from Alfonso VII.In 1219, the king Fernando III gave a new fuero to the city .During the reign of Alfonso X of Castile, the protection of the king allowed the city to develop its economy by protecting merchants and allowing markets.\nQuestion: How many years after the last Battle IN Guadalajara did king Fernando III give a new fuero to the city?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: After an emotional Monday night win against the New England Patriots, the Saints traveled to FedExField in Landover, Maryland for a Week 13 matchup against the Washington Redskins. In the 1st quarter, the Redskins scored first with Jason Campbell throwing an 8-yard touchdown to Fred Davis. Shaun Suisham then kicked a 32-yard field goal to go up 10-0. In the 2nd quarter, the Saints finally scored with a Garrett Hartley 34-yard field goal. After a defensive stance, Drew Brees threw a 40-yard touchdown to Marques Colston which tied the game 10-10. The Redskins retook the lead with Jason Campbell connecting with Devin Thomas for a 10-yard touchdown. With the Saints now down 17-10, Brees and the Saints attempted to drive the field. Brees' pass attempt to Jeremy Shockey was intercepted by Kareem Moore. Robert Meachem then ran into Moore, stripped the football, and returned it for a 44-yard touchdown. In the 3rd quarter, the Redskins kicker Suisham made a 28-yard field goal. The Redskins then extended their lead with Devin Thomas catching a 13-yard touchdown pass from Campbell. The Saints' Hartley made a 27-yard field goal. In the 4th quarter, Shaun Suisham and Garrett Hartley traded field goals. After a field goal miss from 23 yards by Shaun Suisham, the Saints, only down by 7 points, now had the opportunity to tie the game. Drew Brees and the Saints offense drove the field in 5 plays, in 33 seconds and capped the drive with a 53-yard touchdown pass to Robert Meachem to tie the game 30-30 at the end of regulation. The Saints completed the comeback with Garrett Hartley's 18-yard field goal for the first lead in the game and the win 33-30 in overtime. With the win, the Saints improved to 12-0 and clinched the NFC South title. Their 12 wins also tied a single-season franchise record set in the 1987 and 1992 seasons.\nQuestion: How many points did the Saints score in the first quarter?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 0, \n\nPassage: Coming off their win over the Giants, the Eagles stayed at home for a Week 9 Sunday night divisional duel with the Dallas Cowboys with the lead in the NFC East on the line. Philadelphia would trail in the first quarter as Cowboys running back Tashard Choice picked up a 2-yard touchdown run.  The Eagles would respond in the second quarter with a 45-yard and a 48-yard field goal from kicker David Akers, but Dallas would answer with kicker Nick Folk nailing a 22-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Philadelphia would take the lead as quarterback Donovan McNabb found tight end Brent Celek on an 11-yard touchdown pass.  However, the Cowboys struck back in the fourth quarter with Folk's 33-yard field goal and quarterback Tony Romo's 49-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Miles Austin.  The Eagles tried to get a comeback, but could only muster up a 52-yard field goal from Akers.\nQuestion: How many yards was the second longest field goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 48\n\nPassage: In 1616 the Venetians besieged Farra and Gradisca, and the archduke attacked from Gorizia and Lucinico. With three large culverins, four guns and three small culverins, Farra  repulsed the enemy artillery with heavy losses. The Venetians launched another futile assault before Giustiniani lifted the siege and retreated to Mariano. In September, Johan Ernst van Nassau-Siegen agreed to raise 3,000 men from the Dutch Republic for Venetian service. They arrived in May 1617, followed six months later by another 2,000 . Spanish support was blocked at sea by a flotilla of 12 Dutch and 10 English warships and on land by the war in Mantua. Although Archduke Ferdinand had only 4,000 soldiers to defend Gradisca, he received military, political and financial support from the Spanish as part of a larger agreement: Philip agreed to fight the Venetians and support Ferdinand as the next Holy Roman Emperor in return for the cession of Alsace, Finale Ligure and Piombino. This led to a negotiated settlement between Ferdinand and the Venetians in which many Uskok pirates were executed or exiled, and a permanent Austrian garrison was installed in Senj.\nQuestion: Was Archduke Fedinand on the Venetian side or the Spanish side?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Spanish, \n\nPassage:  Trying to snap a six-game losing skid, the Lions returned home for an NFC North rematch the-now 2-time NFC North champion Chicago Bears.

In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as Falcons kicker Jason Elam got a 35-yard field goal.  The 'Bolts would strike back as RB LaDainian Tomlinson got a 3-yard TD run (which was his 136th career TD, tying him with Marshall Faulk for fifth all-time).  Atlanta answered with Elam making a 40-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Falcons took the lead as QB Matt Ryan completed an 18-yard TD pass to former Chargers TE Justin Peelle, along with Atlanta's defense forcing QB Philip Rivers to commit intentional grounding from his own endzone, giving the Falcons a safety. In the third quarter, San Diego began to charge back as safety Eric Weddle returned a fumble 86 yards for a touchdown (with a failed two-point conversion).  In the fourth quarter, Atlanta began to pull away as Ryan completed a 5-yard TD pass to WR Harry Douglas.  The Chargers tried to come back as kicker Nate Kaeding nailed a 28-yard field goal.  However, the Falcons' defense prevented any possible comeback. With the loss, the Chargers fell to 4-8.

After a scoreless first quarter, Chicago trailed as Lions kicker Jason Hanson got a 26-yard field goal, while RB Kevin Jones got a 4-yard TD run. Afterwards, Hanson increased Detroit's lead with a 52-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bears got on the board with QB Brian Griese completing a 20-yard TD pass to rookie TE Greg Olsen for the only score of the period. The Lions sealed Chicago's doom as Hanson nailed a 20-yard field goal, while Detroit's defense held its ground and got the season-sweep. With the loss, the Bears entered their bye week at 3-5.

Ulick's father was from an Anglo-Norman family who had been long settled in the west of Ireland and had become Gaelicised. Although during the early sixteenth century the family had rebelled against the Crown on several occasions, Ulick's father had been a strong supporter of Queen Elizabeth I. He fought on the Queen's side during Tyrone's Rebellion, notably during the victory at the Battle of Kinsale, where he was wounded. After the war he married the widow of The 2nd Earl of Essex, a recent commander in Ireland, who was the daughter of the English Secretary of State and spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham. In 1622, Ulick married his only wife Anne Compton, the daughter of The 1st Earl of Northampton and his wife, Elizabeth Spencer. They had a single child, Margaret Burgh, who married Viscount Muskerry. Ulick was summoned to the House of Lords as Lord Burgh in 1628, and succeeded his father as 5th Earl of Clanricarde in 1635. In 1636, he inherited Somerhill House on the death of his father. He was a staunch opponent of the policies of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, The 1st Earl of Strafford, who had attempted to seize much of the great Burke inheritance for the Crown; there was also personal ill-feeling between the two men since the dispute was thought by many to have hastened the death of Ulick's elderly father. He sat in the Short Parliament of 1640 and attended King Charles I in the Scottish expedition. Charles, unlike Strafford, liked and trusted Lord Clanricarde.\nQuestion: What position did Ulick's father hold?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: The 4th Earl of Clanricarde\n\nPassage: In 1954, under the \"Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands\", the Netherlands, Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles  became a composite kingdom. The former colonies were granted autonomy, save for certain matters including defense, foreign affairs and citizenship, which were the responsibility of the Realm. In 1969, unrest in Cura\u00e7ao led to Dutch marines being sent to quell rioting. In 1973, negotiations started in Suriname for independence, and full independence was granted in 1975, with 60,000 emigrants taking the opportunity of moving to the Netherlands. In 1986, Aruba was allowed to secede from the Netherlands Antilles federation, and was pressured by the Netherlands to move to independence within ten years. However, in 1994, it was agreed that its status as a Realm in its own right could continue. On October 10, 2010, the Netherlands Antilles were dissolved. Effective on that date, Cura\u00e7ao and Sint Maarten acceded to the same country status within the Kingdom that Aruba already enjoyed. The islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba were granted a status similar to Dutch municipalities, and are now sometimes referred to as the Caribbean Netherlands.\nQuestion: How many years after negotiations in Suriname did it take for Suriname to be granted full independence?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2, \n\nPassage:  Trying to snap a six-game losing skid, the Lions returned home for an NFC North rematch the-now 2-time NFC North champion Chicago Bears.

                    "Passage: The Greater Poland uprising of 1918-1919, or Wielkopolska uprising of 1918-1919  or Posnanian War was a military insurrection of Poles in the Greater Poland region  against German rule. The uprising had a significant effect on the Treaty of Versailles, which granted a reconstituted Second Polish Republic the area won by the Polish insurrectionists. The region was part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth before the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 when it was taken over by the German Kingdom of Prussia.\nQuestion: What was Poland fighting?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: German rule, \n\nPassage: With his health continuing to deteriorate, the Black Prince returned to England in January 1371, whereby now his father Edward III was elderly and also in poor health. The prince's illness was debilitating, and he died on 8 June 1376. Edward III died the following year on 21 June 1377; he was succeeded by the Black Prince's second son Richard II , who was still a child. The treaty at Br\u00e9tigny left Edward III and England with enlarged holdings in France; however, a small professional French army under the leadership of du Guesclin pushed the English back and, by the time of Charles V's death in 1380, the English only held Calais and a few other coastal cities. It was usual to appoint a regent in the case of a child monarch, but no regent was appointed for Richard II, who nominally exercised the power of kingship from the date of his accession in 1377. However, between 1377 and 1380, actual power was in the hands of a series of councils. The political community preferred this to a regency led by the king's uncle, John of Gaunt, although Gaunt remained highly influential. Richard faced many challenges during his reign, including the Peasants' Revolt led by Wat Tyler in 1381 and an Anglo-Scottish war in 1384-1385. His attempts to raise taxes to pay for his Scottish adventure and for the protection of Calais against the French made him increasingly unpopular.\nQuestion: How many years did Edward III outlive his son?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1, \n\nPassage: Since 1995, Fortune (magazine) has ranked Adobe as an outstanding place to work.

                    "Passage:  Coming off their bye week and still looking for their first win, the Dolphins went home for an AFC East duel with the Buffalo Bills.  In the first quarter, Miami struck first as kicker Jay Feely managed to get a 38-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the third quarter, the Bills got on the board with DE Chris Kelsay sacking QB Cleo Lemon in the endzone for a safety.  Fortunately, the 'Fins responded with Lemon getting a 5-yard TD run.  Unfortunately, in the fourth quarter, Miami's year-long struggles continued as Buffalo RB Marshawn Lynch got a 3-yard TD run, along with a 2-point conversion run.  Later, the Bills sealed the win as kicker Rian Lindell nailed the game-winning 34-yard field goal. With their ninth-straight loss, the Dolphins fell to 0-9, despite outgaining Buffalo in total offensive yards (269 to 214) and time of possession (36:59 to 23:01). This marked the 5th time this year that Miami lost by 3 points. With the Rams' win over the Saints that same week the Dolphins are now the NFL's only winless team.\nQuestion: Which player got the longest TD run?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Lemon\n\nPassage: Coming off their win over the Redskins, the Dolphins stayed at home for a Week 11 AFC East showdown with the Buffalo Bills.  Miami trailed early in the first quarter as Bills kicker Dave Rayner made a 30-yard field goal, yet the Dolphins immediately answered with quarterback Matt Moore finding tight end Anthony Fasano on a 1-yard touchdown pass, followed by a 5-yard touchdown run from running back Reggie Bush.  Miami would add onto their lead in the second quarter with Moore connecting with fullback Charles Clay on a 12-yard touchdown pass, followed by wide receiver Davone Bess on a 4-yard touchdown pass.  Buffalo would close out the half with Rayner booting a 56-yard field goal. The Dolphins continued their dominating day in the third quarter with running back Lex Hilliard recovering a blocked punt in the endzone for a touchdown (the team's first TD off of a blocked punt since 1990).  The Bills tried to rally as linebacker Kelvin Sheppard tackled rookie running back Daniel Thomas in the endzone for a safety, but Miami's lead proved to be too much to overcome. This game also marked the first time since 1990 that Miami allowed 10 points or fewer in three-straight games.They have now become the 3rd team in NFL History to win 3 straight after starting season at least 0-7 ('78 Cardinals & '86 Colts).\nQuestion: How many yards was the longest field goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 56, \n\nPassage: Up to the end of World War II, the vast majority of the population of Stettin were Lutheran Protestants. Historically, the number of inhabitants doubled from 6,081 in 1720, to 12,360 in 1740, and reached 21,255 in 1812, with only 476 Catholics and 5 Jews.

Seattle would trail early in the first quarter as 49ers kicker Joe Nedney got a 37-yard field goal, along with running back Frank Gore getting a 79-yard touchdown run. The Seahawks would respond in the second quarter as kicker Olindo Mare made a 36-yard field goal. San Francisco would reply with Nedney making a 42-yard field goal. As the Seahawks looked to bounced back from the deficit, quarterback Matt Hasselbeck received an injury as he was hit on the ground by 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis. Hasselbeck would leave the game with cracked ribs, yet Seattle closed out the half with backup Seneca Wallace completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to running back Julius Jones. In the third quarter, the Seahawks deficit quickly increased as on the 49ers' first offensive play of the second half, Gore would explode for an 80-yard touchdown run.

The Patriots marched 80 yards right down the field on their opening possession, scoring on a 43-yard burst by Blount. The next four possessions of the game were punts, but Butler intercepted Jared Goff on the last play of the first quarter and returned it 7 yards to the Rams 30. It only took four plays from Brady to find Chris Hogan on a 14-yard touchdown pass, increasing the Patriots lead to 14-0. After the next three drives ended in punts, the Patriots marched 48 yards to the Rams 10, but as a sign of the Patriots soon-to-come red zone struggles, Stephen Gostkowski kicked a field goal with 0:11 remaining in the first half. The Rams took a knee and the Patriots led 17-0 at halftime. The first two possessions of the second half were punts, but the Rams finally got on board late in the 3rd quarter. After Pharoh Cooper returned a punt 6 yards to the Rams 45, the Rams drove to the Patriots 26-yard line and Greg Zuerlein got the Rams on the scoreboard with a 44-yard field goal. The Patriots countered by driving to the Rams 30 with Gostkowski adding a 48-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 20-3. Kyle Van Noy intercepted Goff on the first play of the Rams next possession. The Patriots only managed to reach the Rams 27, but Gostkowski added a 44-yard field goal. Down 23-3, the Rams were still unable to move the ball and punted. Once again the Patriots drove to the Rams 27 and another 45-yard Gostkowski field goal increased the Patriots lead to 26-3. a few plays into the fourth quarter. Late in the game, Goff hit Kenny Britt for a 66-yard gain to the Patriots 1-yard line. Four plays later, they connected again on a 1-yard touchdown pass, trimming the score to 26-10, but only 1:15 remained. The Patriots recovered the Rams onside kick attempt and ran out the clock to end the game. With the win, the Patriots improved to 10-2, clinching their 14th consecutive 10-win season. The defense dominated, holding the Rams to a paltry 162 yards and just 10 points while forcing two turnovers.

                    "Passage: Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Cowboys the Texans flew to Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum for an AFC duel with the Raiders. The Texans took the early lead in the 1st quarter as RB Derrick Ward got a 33-yard TD run. The Raiders replied with RB Michael Bush making a 2-yard TD run. The Texans got the lead back when QB Matt Schaub completed an 11-yard TD pass to TE Joel Dreessen. The Raiders responded in the 2nd quarter with QB Bruce Gradkowski getting a 13-yard TD pass to FB Marcel Reece. In the 3rd quarter the Texans started to rally with RB Arian Foster making a 74-yard TD run, followed by kicker Neil Rackers getting a 35-yard field goal, then in the 4th quarter Schaub threw a 10-yard TD pass to RB Arian Foster. The lead was cut with Gradkowski found TE Zach Miller on a 14-yard TD pass, and kicker Sebastian Janikowski nailing a 39-yard field goal.\nQuestion: How many yards longer was the longest touchdown run than the shortest?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 72\n\nPassage: The Eagles met the New York Giants in a critical Week 15 matchup and were able to emerge from the Meadowlands with a 36-22 victory. Taking advantage of field position placing them at the Eagles' 21 yard-line, New York's Tiki Barber scored an 11-yard rushing touchdown. After allowing their customary opening score, the Eagles tied the game with a 12-play drive capped by a Correll Buckhalter touchdown. The Eagles took a 14-7 lead in the second quarter when Brian Westbrook dove over the pile for a touchdown on fourth and goal from the Giants' 1-yard line. The Giants then quickly drove down the field to snag a 47-yard Jay Feely field goal right before the end of the first half. After a David Akers field goal miss in the third quarter, Eli Manning connected with Plaxico Burress for 52 yards, leading  to another field goal. A Will Demps sack of Jeff Garcia created a turnover, leading to another New York field goal, giving them a 16-14 lead. Maligned Eagles' kick returner Reno Mahe's 64-yard kickoff return set up a 28-yard rushing touchdown by Westbrook, putting Philadelphia back on top 21-16. After having a questionable taunting penalty called against him, Garcia threw his first interception of the year, leading to a one-yard run by New York goal-line specialist Brandon Jacobs. The Eagles stuffed Tiki Barber on the two-point attempt, holding the Giants' lead to 22-21. Garcia led the Eagles down the field and passed to Reggie Brown for a 19-yard score with under 3 minutes left in regulation. Garcia then found tight end L.J. Smith for the two-point conversion, making it 29-22 Eagles. On the Giants' first play of their next possession, Eli Manning was hit as he threw by cornerback Sheldon Brown, allowing defensive end Trent Cole to gather the interception and return it for a game-clinching touchdown.  Westbrook, who hit the 1,000 yard mark in the first quarter, rushed for 97 yards and two touchdowns, while safety Brian Dawkins led the defense with twelve  tackles, two forced fumbles, and an interception. The hard-fought 36-22 win avenged the Eagles' Week 2 loss to the Giants, moved them up to 8-6 and, more importantly, puts them in a strong position to claim an NFC playoff berth.\nQuestion: How many touchdowns were scored in the first half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3, \n\nPassage: Coming off a 34-7 drubbing of the Arizona Cardinals, the Eagles (4-1) travelled to take on the Carolina Panthers (4-1). The Eagles drove into Panthers territory on their first possession of the game, but a Julius Peppers strip sack against Halapoulivaati Vaitai, who was filling in for a concussed Lane Johnson. The Panthers led 10-3, with their only TD coming from a 16-yard touchdown run from quarterback Cam Newton. Late in the second quarter, rookie cornerback Rasul Douglas intercepted Cam Newton deep in Panthers territory, leading to a Zach Ertz 1 yard touchdown reception. The Eagles opened up the second half with another Zach Ertz touchdown, a 17-yard strike from Carson Wentz. Leading 21-16 after three quarters, the Eagles opened up the fourth quarter with Carson Wentz hooking up with wide receiver Nelson Agholor for a 24-yard touchdown. Cam Newton led the Panthers on a long touchdown drive, trimming the score to 28-23. A late interception by cornerback Jalen Mills and a fourth down stop by the Eagles defense sealed the Eagles fifth victory of the season, and proved they were a legitimate contender in the NFC.\nQuestion: How many yards was the touchdown from Ertz in the second half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 17, \n\nPassage:  Trying to snap a six-game losing skid, the Lions returned home for an NFC North rematch the-now 2-time NFC North champion Chicago Bears.

                    "Passage: Trying to snap a three-game losing streak, the Colts flew to LP Field for a Week 14 AFC South duel with the Tennessee Titans on Thursday night.  Indianapolis delivered the game's opening strike in the first quarter with a 1-yard touchdown run from rookie running back Javarris James.  The Colts would add onto their lead in the second quarter as quarterback Peyton Manning found wide receiver Pierre Gar&#231;on on a 1-yard and a 19-yard touchdown pass.  The Titans responded with running back Chris Johnson getting a 1-yard touchdown run. Tennessee began to cut away at their deficit in the third quarter as quarterback Kerry Collins completed a 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Craig Stevens, yet Indianapolis responded with a 21-yard field goal from kicker Adam Vinatieri.  The Colts added onto their lead in the fourth quarter with a 28-yard field goal from Vinatieri.  The Titans tried to rally as Collins completed a 9-yard touchdown pass to tight end Bo Scaife, yet Indianapolis rose to the challenge with Vinatieri booting a 47-yard field goal.  Tennessee closed out the game with Collins completing a 2-yard touchdown pass to Scaife.\nQuestion: How many yards difference was there between Kerry Collins\u2019s touchdown pass to Craig Stevens than Kerry Collins\u2019s first touchdown pass to  Bo Scaife?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2\n\nPassage: Coming off their win over the Saints, the Falcons stayed at home for a Week 11 interconference duel with the Denver Broncos.  In the first quarter, Atlanta trailed early as Broncos FB Peyton Hillis got a 7-yard TD run. The Falcons would answer with kicker Jason Elam (a former Bronco) getting a 46-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Atlanta took the lead as Elam made a 36-yard field goal, while RB Michael Turner got a 9-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Denver retook the lead as Hillis got a 2-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Broncos increased their lead as kicker Matt Prater nailed a 20-yard field goal.  The Falcons tried to rally as Turner got a 28-yard field goal, yet Denver replied with quarterback Jay Cutler competing a 9-yard TD pass to TE Daniel Graham.  From there on out, the Broncos' defense stopped any other possible comeback attempt. With their first home loss of the year, Atlanta fell to 6-4. This was the first of only two home losses suffered by Matt Ryan in the NFL through 12/27/2010.

Washington won the toss, and elected to receive the opening kick. Washington quarterback Jason Campbell was intercepted early in the drive by Ravens safety Ed Reed. Baltimore running back Le'Ron McClain converted the turnover into points when he scored a rushing TD on the ensuing Ravens possession. Later in the first quarter, the Ravens defense struck for a defensive touchdown when Ed Reed recovered a fumble from Washington running back Clinton Portis. In the third quarter, Ravens kicker Matt Stover extended the Ravens lead with a 32-yard field goal. Early in the fourth quarter, Washington got on the board with a Shaun Suisham 43-yard field goal. Baltimore running back Willis McGahee fumbled on the Raven's next possession, and the Redskins cut the Ravens lead to 17-10 on a touchdown pass to Antwaan Randle-El.

                    "Passage: After their bye week, the Lions traveled to Chicago, Illinois for a rematch with their division foes the Chicago Bears. Chicago started the scoring with a 6-yard touchdown rush by Matt Forte. The Bears added to their lead with a 43-yard field goal by Robbie Gould. In the second quarter, Chicago added more points with a 35-yard field goal, and made it a 20-0 game when Devin Hester returned a punt 82 yards for a touchdown. Detroit finally got on the board with two consecutive field goals by Jason Hanson, from 29 and 35 yards out respectively. After halftime, the Bears defense intercepted Lions QB Matthew Stafford twice for touchdowns. First, Major Wright caught one and ran it in 24 yards. Then Charles Tillman completed a 44-yard pick 6. The Bears added to their large lead with a 50-yard field goal. The Lions scored their only points of the second half with a 10-yard touchdown catch by Tony Scheffler. This was the Lions' first road loss of the season. The game was marred by an on-field fight between players midway through the 4th quarter.\nQuestion: How many total combined points were scored by the half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 26, \n\nPassage: The Industrial Workers of the World , whose members became known as \"Wobblies\", was founded in Chicago in 1905 by a group of about 30 labor radicals. Their most prominent leader was William \"Big Bill\" Haywood. The IWW pioneered creative tactics, and organized along the lines of industrial unionism rather than craft unionism; in fact, they went even further, pursuing the goal of \"One Big Union\" and the abolition of the wage system. Many, though not all, Wobblies favored anarcho-syndicalism. Much of the IWW's organizing took place in the West, and most of its early members were miners, lumbermen, cannery, and dock workers. In 1912 the IWW organized a strike of more than twenty thousand textile workers, and by 1917 the Agricultural Workers Organization  of the IWW claimed a hundred thousand itinerant farm workers in the heartland of North America. Eventually the concept of One Big Union spread from dock workers to maritime workers, and thus was communicated to many different parts of the world. Dedicated to workplace and economic democracy, the IWW allowed men and women as members, and organized workers of all races and nationalities, without regard to current employment status. At its peak it had 150,000 members , but it was fiercely repressed during, and especially after, World War I with many of its members killed, about 10,000 organizers imprisoned, and thousands more deported as foreign agitators. The IWW proved that unskilled workers could be organized. The IWW exists today, but its most significant impact was during its first two decades of existence.\nQuestion: How many years after the \"Wobblies\" was founded did the IWW organize a strike of more than twenty thousand textile workers?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 6\n\nPassage: The Seahawks travelled to Denver to face their old foe from the AFC West. On a frigid Sunday Night game, these Seahawks were able to accomplish what few of their predecessors managed - to come out of Denver with a win. Carrying on their recent troubling tendency of weak first half performances, the Seahawks fell behind 13-7 to the Broncos, who were led by first-time starter Jay Cutler. The Seahawks managed only 2 first downs and 67 yards of total offense in the first half, but remained in the game thanks to Darryl Tapp's 25-yard return of an intercepted Cutler pass for a TD. In the second half, the teams traded punts and one turnover apiece until Seattle got the ball on its own 39-yard line with 9:42 left in the game. Two long pass completions from Matt Hasselbeck to Darrell Jackson put the Seahawks on the Broncos one-yard line. Shaun Alexander quickly took the ball into the endzone for a 14-13 Seahawks lead. The Broncos fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and Joe Tafoya recovered. Assisted by a holding penalty on third down, the Seahawks moved the ball into range for Josh Brown to kick a 44-yard field goal. The Broncos held onto the following kickoff, but on their first play Cutler threw an interception to Jordan Babineaux for Seattle's  9th takeaway in the past two games. The Seahawks again had to settle for a Brown 23-yard field goal for a 20-13 lead with 3:01 remaining, keeping Denver in the game. The failure to score a TD proved costly, as Cutler connected with WR Brandon Marshall on a 71-yard pass and run play for a game tying TD, assisted by some poor tackling by Seattle. The Seahawks started the last drive at their own 14-yard line with 2:31 remaining. A key third down reception by Nate Burleson kept the drive alive, and Hasselbeck led the team down to the Broncos 32-yard line with 10 seconds remaining. Josh Brown came on to kick a game-winning, 50-yard FG, his fourth such kick of the season to tie an NFL record. With the win the Seahawks' lead in the NFC West increased to three games over the 49ers and Rams as they improved to 8-4.\nQuestion: How many more wins than losses did the Seahawks have after this game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 4\n\nPassage:  Trying to snap a six-game losing skid, the Lions returned home for an NFC North rematch the-now 2-time NFC North champion Chicago Bears.

The Dolphins marched to the Patriots 38 on the opening drive, but punted. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Dolphins marched 64 yards in 7 plays, scoring on a 19-yard touchdown pass from Chad Henne to Davone Bess on a 19-yard touchdown pass and a 7-0 lead. Four plays after the Patriots punted again, Ninkovich intercepted Henne at the Patriots 40. The Patriots drove all the way to the Dolphins 5, but settled for a 23-yard field goal by Gostkowski. The Dolphins drove to the Patriots 27 on their next drive, but Henne was intercepted again by Ninkovich at the 25. The Patriots drove all the way to the Dolphins 12, but again settled for a field goal, making the score 7-6 Dolphins at halftime. Tate returned the opening kickoff of the second half 103 yards for a touchdown, giving the Patriots the lead, 13-7 that they wouldn't relinquish. Chung blocked Brandon Fields' punt, with Brandon Spikes recovering at the Dolphins 15. Two plays later, the Patriots scored on a 12-yard touchdown run by Green-Ellis, increasing the lead to 20-7. The Dolphins answered on their next drive, marching 80 yards in 8 plays, scoring on a 28-yard screen pass to Ricky Williams, bringing the score to 20-14. The Patriots countered, driving 78 yards in 12 plays, scoring on an 11-yard screen pass to Woodhead, increasing the lead to 27-14. The Dolphins drove to the Patriots 29 on their next drive, but after a 7-yard sack by Ninkovich, attempted a 54-yard field goal, but the kick was blocked Chung with Kyle Arrington returning it 35 yards for a touchdown, increasing the lead to 34-14. The Dolphins reached their own 45 on their next drive, but Ronnie Brown was stuffed for no gain on 4th-and-2. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Dolphins drove to their own 47, but Chung intercepted Henne at the Patriots 49 and returned it 51 yards for a touchdown, increasing the lead to 41-14. The Dolphins drove to the Patriots 40 again on their next drive, but rookie Jarrad Page intercepted Henne at the Patriots 23. The Patriot ran out the rest of the clock to win the game. With the win, not only did the Patriots head into their bye week at 3-1, but Brady picked up his 100th win in the fewest career starts (131) in NFL history.

                    "Passage: Thompson was born into a middle-class family in Louisville, Kentucky, the first of three sons of Virginia Ray Davison , who worked as head librarian at the Louisville Free Public Library and Jack Robert Thompson , a public insurance adjuster and World War I veteran. His parents were introduced to each other by a friend from Jack's fraternity at the University of Kentucky in September 1934, and married on November 2, 1935. Thompson's first name came from a purported ancestor on his mother's side, the Scottish surgeon John Hunter. Hunter Stockton was named for his maternal grandparents, Prestly Stockton Ray and Lucille Hunter. On December 2, 1943, when Thompson was six years old, the family settled at 2437 Ransdell Avenue in the affluent Cherokee Triangle neighborhood of The Highlands. On July 3, 1952, when Thompson was 14 years old, his father, aged 58, died of myasthenia gravis. Hunter and his brothers were raised by their mother. Hunter also had a much older half-brother, James Thompson, Jr., from his father's first marriage, who was not part of the Thompson household. Virginia worked as a librarian to support her children, and is described as having become a \"heavy drinker\" following her husband's death.\nQuestion: How many children in all did Jack Robert Thompson have?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 4, \n\nPassage: He was however forced to fall back across the Danube, and the Ottomans in turn led a massive counter-offensive  which aimed to not only take back their recently captured possessions but also conquer Wallachia once and for all. The push was initially successful, managing to capture not only Giurgiu but also Bucharest and T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte, in spite of meeting fierce opposition at C\u0103lug\u0103reni . At this point the Ottoman command grew complacent and stopped pursuing the retreating Wallachian army, focusing instead on fortifying T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte and Bucharest and considering their task all but done. Michael had to wait almost two months for aid from his allies to arrive, but when it did his counter-offensive took the Ottomans by surprise, managing to sweep through the Ottoman defences on three successive battlefields, at T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte , Bucharest , and Giurgiu . The Battle of Giurgiu in particular was devastating for the Ottoman forces, which had to retreat across the Danube in disarray. The war between Wallachia and the Ottomans continued until late 1599, when Michael was unable to continue the war due to poor support from his allies. The turning point of the war was the Battle of Mez\u0151keresztes, which took place in the territory of Hungary on October 24-26, 1596. The combined Habsburg-Transylvanian force of 45-50,000 troops was defeated by the Ottoman army. The battle turned when Christian soldiers, thinking they had won the battle, stopped fighting in order to plunder the Ottoman camp. Despite this victory, the Ottomans realized for the first time the superiority of Western military equipment over Ottoman weapons. This battle was the first significant military encounter in Central-Europe between a large Christian army and the Ottoman Turkish Army after the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs. Nevertheless, Austrians recaptured Gy\u0151r and Komarom in 1598.\nQuestion: Which happened first, the Battle of Mezokeresztes or the war between Wallachia and the Ottomans?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Battle of Mez\u0151keresztes, \n\nPassage: Trying to snap a three-game skid, the Falcons went home and played a Week 9 interconference duel with the San Francisco 49ers. In the first quarter, Atlanta trailed early as 49ers RB Maurice Hicks got a 9-yard TD run. The Falcons responded with RB Warrick Dunn getting a 9-yard TD run. In the second quarter, Atlanta increased its lead with RB Ovie Mughelli getting a 1-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the third quarter, San Francisco crept close as kicker Joe Nedney got a 49-yard and a 32-yard field goal.  Fortunately, in the fourth quarter, the Falcons answered with kicker Morten Andersen getting a 33-yard field goal. The 49ers responded with Nedney kicking a 22-yard field goal, yet Atlanta got the win with Andersen nailing a 27-yard field goal. The struggling Falcons rushing attack had its best performance (to date) with 155 total rushing yards.\nQuestion: How many field goas were kicked that were over 30 yards?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3\n\nPassage: In 1905, 1,003 Korean immigrants, which included 802 men and 231 women and children, departed from the port of Chemulpo, Incheon aboard the ship Ilford to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, Mexico.

                    "Passage: In week 6, the Lions hosted the Los Angeles Rams. The score seesawed the entire game. The Lions scored first with a seven-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford to Marvin Jones. The Rams tied it up with a 20-yard touchdown pass from Case Keenum to Kenny Britt, and took the lead in the second quarter with a one-yard touchdown run by Keenum. The Lions tied it back up with a two-yard touchdown catch by Andre Roberts on fourth down, and stopped the Rams from taking the lead with a goal line stand as time expired in the second quarter, keeping the score tied 14-14 at halftime. After the break, the Lions took the lead back with a four-yard touchdown catch by Anquan Boldin, but the Rams tied it back up with a 15-yard catch by Lance Kendricks. Los Angeles then retook the lead in the fourth quarter with a nine-yard catch from Britt, but Detroit tied it up again on a 23-yard TD catch by Golden Tate. The Lions took the lead for good with a 34-yard field goal by Matt Prater at the 1:29 mark of the final quarter. Detroit prevented the Rams from getting into range for a game-tying field goal when Rafael Bush intercepted a Keenum pass with just over a minute to play, giving the Lions a 31-28 win and improving their record to 3-3. Golden Tate tallied a career-high 165 yards on eight receptions. The Lions celebrated the 25th anniversary of their 1991 NFC Central Championship with an on-field reunion of its players at halftime.\nQuestion: How many touchdowns did both teams score before halftime?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2, \n\nPassage: Eight college football games were played at Yankee Stadium on Thanksgiving (United States), the first seven by New York University. Perhaps, the most famous Thanksgiving Day game was the first. Oregon State Agricultural College (now Oregon State Beavers football) was the first West Coast team to travel across the country and play an East Coast team. 8\u20131 NYU was a 3\u20131 favorite to beat 5\u20133 OSAC, but Oregon State upset the hometown favorites 25\u201313. Will Rogers lamented what the \"Oregon apple knockers\" had done to his \"city slickers\" in a column after the game. After the 1928 game, NYU beat Carnegie Tech (now Carnegie Mellon University) in 1931 and 1932, defeated Fordham in 1936, lost to Carnegie Tech in 1929 and lost to Fordham in 1934 and 1935. In the eighth game, in 1963, Syracuse beat Notre Dame, 14\u20137. This was a rematch following the teams controversial 1961 game won by Notre Dame, 17\u201315.\nQuestion: How many times did NYU play Carnegie Tech at Yankee Stadium on Thanksgiving?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3, \n\nPassage: The persecutions did not end, however. In violation of the promise made by Beria to the arrested opposition leaders, mass arrests and executions continued. The political guidance of the anti-revolt operations was effected by the GPU chief in Georgia, Solomon Mogilevsky, and the repressions were largely supported by the Transcaucasian Central Committee. Stalin himself is quoted to have vowed that \"all of Georgia must be plowed under\". In a series of raids, the Red Army and Cheka detachments killed thousands of civilians, exterminating entire families including women and children. Mass executions took place in prisons, where people were killed without trial, including even those in prison at the time of the rebellion. Hundreds of arrested were shot directly in railway trunks, so that the dead bodies could be removed faster\u2014a new and effective technical invention by the Cheka officer, Talakhadze. The exact number of casualties and the victims of the purges remains unknown. Approximately 3,000 died in fighting. The number of those who were executed during the uprising or in its immediate aftermath amounted to 7,000-10,000 or even more. According to the most recent accounts included also in The Black Book of Communism , 12,578 people were put to death from 29 August to 5 September 1924. About 20,000 people were deported to Siberia and Central Asian deserts.\nQuestion: Which group had the largest amount of people, put to death or executed?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: executed, \n\nPassage: In 1905, 1,003 Korean immigrants, which included 802 men and 231 women and children, departed from the port of Chemulpo, Incheon aboard the ship Ilford to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, Mexico.

In the first quarter, Carolina trailed early as Cowboys QB Tony Romo completed a 10-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, Dallas increased its lead with RB Marion Barber getting a 5-yard TD run. The Panthers got on the board with Matt Moore completing an 11-yard TD pass to WR Steve Smith. The Cowboys ended the half with kicker Nick Folk getting a 42-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Carolina began rallying with John Kasay getting a 37-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Dallas responded with Folk kicking a 23-yard field goal. The Panthers tried to come back as Kasay nailed a 25-yard field goal, but the Cowboys' defense held on for the win. With the loss, not only did Carolina fall to 6-9, but it also eliminated them from the playoff race.\nQuestion: How many yards difference is there between the longest and shortest field goals?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 19, \n\nPassage: Coming off their last-second win over the Dolphins, the Texans continued their home stand with a Week 7 interconference duel with the winless Detroit Lions.  In the first quarter, Houston drew first blood as QB Matt Schaub completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Owen Daniels, along with RB Ahman Green getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Texans increased their lead as rookie RB Steve Slaton got a 1-yard TD run.  The Lions would respond with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 54-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Detroit tried to catch up as RB Kevin Smith got a 26-yard TD run.  Houston would answer with Schaub hooking up with Daniels again on a 1-yard TD pass.  In the fourth quarter, the Lions tried to rally as QB Dan Orlovsky completed a 96-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson, along with Hanson nailing a 54-yard field goal.  Fortunately, the Texans' defense stiffened for the victory.\nQuestion: How many 54-yard field goals were kicked?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2\n\nPassage: The Patriots traveled to Miami to face the Dolphins, looking to clinch the AFC East, playing their first game without Gronkowski since Week 6 vs the Saints. After a Dolphins punt, the Patriots marched 83 yards to the Dolphins 4 on their opening drive, which took half of the quarter, but ended with a Gostkowski field goal. The next four drives of the game ended in punts. Midway through the second quarter, the Dolphins reached the Patriots 24. However, John Denney fumbled the snap and Nate Ebner recovered at the Patriots 31. The Patriots stormed 69 yards, scoring on Brady's 13-yard touchdown pass to Michael Hoomanawanui, increasing the lead to 10-0. The Dolphins got on the board on their next drive, racing 82 yards in just over a minutes, with Tannehill bombing a 39-yard touchdown pass to Wallace, making the score 10-7 Patriots at halftime. The Patriots drove all the way to the Dolphins 20 on their next drive, but Gostkowski missed a 38-yard field goal. The Dolphins managed to drive all the way to the Patriots 14, but could only chalk up a 32-yard field goal, tying the game 10-10. After a Patriots punt, the Dolphins strung together a 10 play, 66-yard drive, scoring on a 2-yard touchdown pass to Daniel Thomas, giving the Dolphins a 17-10 lead a few plays into the fourth quarter. The Patriots responded by driving all the way to the Dolphins 5-yard line, but were forced to settle for a 23-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 17-13. After a Dolphins punt, the Patriots raced 73 yards in just 6 plays, scoring on Brady's 24-yard touchdown pass to Edelman, giving the Patriots a 20-17 lead with just 4:07 remaining in the fourth quarter. However, Gostkowski booted the ensuing kickoff out of bounds, giving the Dolphins the ball at their own 40. Facing a 3rd-and-16 at their own 34, Tannehill hit Brian Hartline for an 11-yard gain, then on 4th-and-5, Tannehill hit Charles Clay for a 6-yard gain and a first-down. Five plays later, Tannehill hit Marcus Thigpen for a 14-yard touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 24-20 lead with 1:15 remaining in the game. Facing a 4th-and-8 at their own 33, Brady hit Amendola for a 12-yard gain. Four plays later, Brady converted at 3rd-and-10 with a 12-yard screen pass to Edelman to the Dolphins 19. Four plays later, facing a 4th-and-5 at the Dolphins 14, Brady was intercepted in the end zone by Michael Thomas with 0:02 seconds left. Tannehill took a knee and the Dolphins won the game.

                    "Passage: In week thirteen, the Bears visited the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome to play the Vikings, whom the Bears trailed 50-53-2 in the all-time series. Josh McCown was given the start for the third straight week, with an expectation that Jay Cutler would return the following week. McCown entered the game having a 65.5 completion percentage for 1,106 yards, seven touchdowns, an interception, and a 100.8 passer rating. As a result, McCown had an advantage over the Vikings' pass defense, which ranked 29th in the league with 282 passing yards allowed, while also allowing quarterbacks to record a 65 completion percentage, 40 attempts per game, and a 97.7 passer rating. Also, the Vikings allowed 31.5 points per game, the worst in the NFL, while recording only 14 turnovers. However, the Bears' defense was a weakness, ranking last in rushing yards allowed per game (145.2), total yards (1,597) and first-downs allowed (89); the defense was 31st in the NFL in yards per carry (4.9), first-down percentage (27.1) and 20-plus yard runs (12). Additionally, the defense allowed running backs in the previous five games to rush for 999 yards, average 5.8 yards per carry, and 197 yards per game. Adrian Peterson ran for an average of 108 yards per game in his career against the Bears, including 120.6 in the last three meetings between the two. Minnesota's rushing game also ran for a year-best 232 yards in the previous week. Cutler, Lance Briggs, Major Wright, Anthony Walters, James Brown, Jonathan Scott, and Cornelius Washington were inactive for the Bears. In the first quarter, McCown had a pass intercepted by Chad Greenway, but an offsides penalty on Robert Blanton nullified the play; the drive would end with the only score of the first quarter via Robbie Gould's 30-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Cordarrelle Patterson's 33-yard touchdown run gave the Vikings the lead; Gould would subsequently kick a 40-yard field goal. Before the half ended, Christian Ponder suffered from symptoms of a concussion and left. On the Bears' first drive of the second half, McCown threw an 80-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. After the Vikings responded with Blair Walsh's 32-yard field goal, Jeffery caught a 46-yard touchdown pass over Viking cornerback Chris Cook to give Chicago the lead 20-10; Cook would eventually be ejected from the game for shoving side judge Laird Hayes. On Minnesota's first possession of the final quarter, Matt Cassel threw an eight-yard touchdown to Greg Jennings, and on Chicago's next drive, McCown's flip pass for Kyle Long was deflected and stripped by Audie Cole, with Marvin Mitchell recovering. Despite starting the drive in the Bears' red zone and reaching the six-yard line, Cassel's pass for Rhett Ellison was tipped and intercepted by Khaseem Greene. After the Bears punted, Cassel fumbled on the first play, but recovered. Afterwards, the Vikings drove from their own six-yard line to the Bears' 12, where Walsh tied the game with a 30-yard field goal, making the score 20-20. On the final play of regulation, Gould's attempted 66-yard field goal fell short. In overtime, the Bears' opening drive ended after McCown was sacked by Jared Allen and fumbled, with Jermon Bushrod recovering, prompting the Bears to punt. On the Vikings' first drive of the period, Walsh's 39-yard field goal was overruled by Ellison's facemasking penalty; Walsh would miss the eventual 57-yarder. The Bears would reach the Vikings' 29-yard line, and on second down, Gould missed the 47-yard kick wide right. The Vikings would reach Chicago's 16-yard line, allowing Walsh to kick the game-winning 34-yard field goal. Marc Trestman received criticism for calling Gould to attempt the 47-yard field goal on second down, with the Chicago Sun-Times calling the choice \"an indefensible case of playing scared.\" Trestman responded by stating he did not want to lose a fumble or suffer a penalty. Jeffery set the team record for the most receiving yards in one game with 249, surpassing his previous record set against the Saints in week 5.\nQuestion: How many total yards of field goals did Walsh miss?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 57\n\nPassage: On November 29, 2011, a Forbes magazine report valued the Ottawa Senators Hockey Club at $201 million, (17th highest in NHL). The valuation was based on $27 million for the sport, $70 million for the arena, $80 million for the market and $25 million for the brand. For 2010\u201311, the club had an operating income of $2.8 million on revenues of $100 million. The gate receipts for the 2010\u201311 season were $46 million and player expenses were $57 million. The operating income followed two years where the team posted a loss. Forbes estimates that the organization has a debt/value ratio of 65%, including arena debt. Eugene Melnyk bought the team for $92 million in 2003. A November 2014 report by Forbes valued the Senators at $400 million, 16th highest in the NHL.\nQuestion: How many millions of dollars did the value of the Ottawa Senators increase between 2011 and 2014?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 199\n\nPassage: Coming off their bye week, the Texans were at home for a Week 11 interconference duel with the New Orleans Saints.  In the first quarter, Houston trailed early as Saints kicker Olindo Mare completed a 52-yard field goal.  Fortunately, the Texans responded with QB Matt Schaub completing a 73-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson.  In the second quarter, New Orleans regained the lead with QB Drew Brees completing a 6-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson.  Fortunately, Houston would reply with Schaub completing a 10-yard TD pass to TE Joel Dreesen, along with kicker Kris Brown getting a 36-yard field goal. After a scoreless third quarter, the Texans took control in the fourth quarter as Brown nailed a 53-yard and a 23-yard field goal. With the win, the Texans (for the first time in franchise history) improved to 5-5. Andre Johnson, in his first game back from injuries, had an impressive day with 6 receptions for 120 yards and 1 touchdown. DE Mario Williams had a big game, as he had 6 tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble.\nQuestion: How many yards was the longest field goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 53, \n\nPassage: In 1905, 1,003 Korean immigrants, which included 802 men and 231 women and children, departed from the port of Chemulpo, Incheon aboard the ship Ilford to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, Mexico.

The Bears reduced the Lions lead to three points via a 31-yard touchdown pass from Matt Barkley to Cameron Meredith. The Bears regained the lead in the fourth quarter via a 24-yard interception return from Cre'Von LeBlanc. The Lions responded with a seven-yard touchdown run from Stafford with 3:17 left in the game, giving the Lions a 20-17 lead they held onto for the win, and breaking an NFL record with 8 comebacks in a single season. With the win, the Lions have won five games in a row for the first time since 2011. The Lions have also held opponents to 20 points or fewer in seven straight games, their longest such streak since 1961.\nQuestion: Which player kicked the second longest field goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Connor Barth\n\nPassage: After a great season for the Miami Dolphins in 2008, the Dolphins went to the Georgia Dome to take on 2008 playoff contenders, the Atlanta Falcons.After a scoreless first quarter, the Falcons got on the board with a 1-yard touchdown pass from Matt Ryan to fullback Ovie Mughelli in the second quarter. They also got a 36-yard field goal by kicker Jason Elam to make the score 10-0 at halftime. In the third quarter, Mike Peterson intercepted a Chad Pennington pass, which set up a 20-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tony Gonzalez and a 50-yard field goal by Jason Elam to make the score 19-0. Chad Pennington then hit a 9-yard touchdown pass to Ricky Williams. The Falcons won the game 19-7 as the Dolphins started their season 0-1. In 2008, no other team turned the ball over less than the Dolphins with only 13 turnovers, but in Week 1 Miami's offense had 4 turnovers, without having a single turnover on defense.\nQuestion: How many touchdowns had the Falcons scored by halftime?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1, \n\nPassage: In 1905, 1,003 Korean immigrants, which included 802 men and 231 women and children, departed from the port of Chemulpo, Incheon aboard the ship Ilford to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, Mexico. The journey took 45 days, after which they took a train to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. In the Veracruz port, another boat was taken to the port of Progreso with the final destination being the capital city of M\u00e9rida, Yucatan. They arrived in May 1905, with previously signed contracts for four years' work as indentured laborers on the Yucat\u00e1n henequen haciendas. Many of these Koreans were distributed throughout the Yucat\u00e1n in 32 henequen haciendas. The town of Motul, Yucatan, located in the heart of the henequen zone, was a destination for many of the Korean immigrants. Subsequently, in 1909, at the end of their contracts, they began a new stage in which they scattered even further  Thus, the majority of those who came were single men who made or remade their family lives with Yucatecan especially Maya women. While Korean girls were much more subject to marriages arranged by Korean parents, males had greater freedom when it came to making a family. This rapid intermarriage by Koreans, coupled with geographic dispersal, prevented the establishment of close social networks among these migrants and therefore provided the basis for Korean descendants among the Yucatan Peninsula.

                    "Passage: Trying to rebound from their home loss to the Colts, the Patriots stayed at home for a rainy AFC East rematch with the Jets.  After a scoreless first quarter, the Patriots struck first with a Gostkowski 31-yard field goal.  However, the Jets would fire back with running back Kevan Barlow getting a touchdown on a two-yard run.  Gostkowski would get one more field goal for New England, in the form of a 21-yarder.  In the third quarter, New York kicker Mike Nugent kicked a 34-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Jets continued their pursuit, as Pennington completed a 22-yard touchdown pass to Cotchery.  The Patriots tried to fight back, as Brady completed a 15-yard touchdown pass to Caldwell, following it up with a successful two-point conversion pass to Caldwell.  However, New York's defense managed to bottle up any chance of a New England comeback.   With the loss, the Patriots would lead the Jets by one game in the AFC East at 6-3. Also with the loss, the Patriots' 57-game streak without consecutive losses, which dated back to the 2002 season, was snapped. The San Francisco 49ers still hold the record of 60-straight games without consecutive losses (1995 - 1999). For Tom Brady, this would be his last regular-season loss at home until Week 9 of the 2011 season. This turned out to be the last time Brady lost at home to another AFC team during the regular season until Week 17 of the 2014 season. After the game was played on a completely sodden, torn-up natural grass field, the Patriots used the two-week interval before the next home game to install a new \"FieldTurf\" surface at Gillette Stadium.\nQuestion: Which players scored a touchdown longer than 10 yards?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Cotchery, Caldwell\n\nPassage: The Colts began their season on the road against the Bears.  The game was highly hyped due to the start of the career of rookie QB Andrew Luck.  The Colts drew first blood in the first quarter as Jerrell Freeman returned an interception 3 yards for a touchdown and a 7-0 lead.  However, the Bears tied the game with Michael Bush's 1-yard run to tie the game at 7-7.  In the 2nd quarter, the Bears took the lead as Brandon Marshall caught a 3-yard touchdown pass from Jay Cutler to make the score 14-7.  They then increased their lead when Robbie Gould scored a 35-yard field goal to make the score 17-7.  The Colts drew closer to shorten the lead to 3 with Donald Brown's 18-yard touchdown run to make the score 17-14.  However, with just seconds before halftime, the Bears drove down the field while Michael Bush ran in on a 1-yard touchdown for a 24-14 halftime lead.  In the 3rd quarter the Bears gained momentum once more with Matt Forte's 6-yard touchdown run for a 31-14 lead and then Robbie Gould's 26-yard field goal for a 34-14 lead.  In the fourth quarter, Luck threw his first touchdown pass of the regular season.  A 4-yard pass to Donnie Avery to shorten the lead to 34-21.  However, the Bears capitalized the victory with Cutler's 42-yard pass to Alshon Jeffery for a final score of 41-21.\nQuestion: By how many points did the bears win?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 20, \n\nPassage: According to ISTAT, in 2014 there were 154,356 people residing in Cagliari (+3.0% compared with 2011), of whom 71,522 were male and 82,834 female for a sex ratio of 0.86. Minors (children aged 18 and younger) totalled 12.92% of the population, compared to pensioners at 24.81%. The average age of Cagliari residents is 47.44. The ratio of the population over 65 years of age to that under the age of 18, is 53.39%. The elderly population, defined as being over 65 years of age, has increased by 21.95% over the last 10 years. The current birth rate in Cagliari is 6.29 births per 1,000 inhabitants. The average number of people of any age per household is 2.11 and the percentage of households composed of a single person is 42.53%. The population of Cagliari is structured like that of other first world countries, especially as to the prevalence of an elderly population. The trend of these rates in the Cagliari metropolitan area is proportionally reversed in the suburbs, where most younger families move.\nQuestion: Which rate in Cagliari is largest, birth rate or per household?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: birth rate\n\nPassage: In 1905, 1,003 Korean immigrants, which included 802 men and 231 women and children, departed from the port of Chemulpo, Incheon aboard the ship Ilford to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, Mexico.

The journey took 45 days, after which they took a train to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. In the Veracruz port, another boat was taken to the port of Progreso with the final destination being the capital city of M\u00e9rida, Yucatan. They arrived in May 1905, with previously signed contracts for four years' work as indentured laborers on the Yucat\u00e1n henequen haciendas. Many of these Koreans were distributed throughout the Yucat\u00e1n in 32 henequen haciendas. The town of Motul, Yucatan, located in the heart of the henequen zone, was a destination for many of the Korean immigrants. Subsequently, in 1909, at the end of their contracts, they began a new stage in which they scattered even further  Thus, the majority of those who came were single men who made or remade their family lives with Yucatecan especially Maya women. While Korean girls were much more subject to marriages arranged by Korean parents, males had greater freedom when it came to making a family. This rapid intermarriage by Koreans, coupled with geographic dispersal, prevented the establishment of close social networks among these migrants and therefore provided the basis for Korean descendants among the Yucatan Peninsula. After that 1905 ship, no further entries of Koreans into Mexico were recorded, until many years later, leading to a new community of Koreans with completely different characteristics from those who entered in 1905. These descendants have started the Museo Conmemorativo de la Inmigraci\u00f3n Coreana a Yucat\u00e1n, a museum for the remembrance of their ancestors journey.\nQuestion: How many more men were there than women and children who departed from the port of Chemulpo, Incheon aboard the ship Ilford to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, Mexico?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: Pew Research Center indicated that (as of 2014) 21 surveyed countries have a positive view (50% or above) of China. With the top ten most positive countries being Pakistan (78%), Tanzania (77%), Bangladesh (77%), Malaysia (74%), Kenya (74%), Thailand (72%), Senegal (71%), Nigeria (70%), Venezuela (67%), and Indonesia (66%). While ten surveyed countries have the most negative view (Below 50%) of China. With the countries being Japan (7%), Vietnam (16%), Turkey (21%), Italy (26%), Germany (28%), India (31%), Poland (32%), Jordan (35%), United States (35%), and Colombia (38%). Chineses own view of China was viewed at 96%.\nQuestion: How many more people, in terms of percentage, viewed China positively in Pakistan compared to Japan and Vietnam combined?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 55\n\nPassage: Game summaryComing off their season-sweep over the Jaguars, the Colts flew to M&T Bank Stadium for a Week 14 Sunday Night duel with the Baltimore Ravens, in the rematch of last year's AFC Divisional duel. In the first quarter, Indianapolis got onto the scoreboard first with QB Peyton Manning completing a 34-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne, while RB Joseph Addai got a 1-yard TD run. Afterwards, Manning and Addai hooked up with each other on a 19-yard TD pass, while rookie CB Michael Coe blocked a punt, causing it go through the back of Baltimore's end zone for a safety. In the second quarter, Addai made an 11-yard TD run. The Ravens immediately responded as WR Yamon Figurs returned a kickoff 94&#160;yards for a touchdown, yet Indianapolis continued its run with Manning completing a 57-yard TD pass to rookie WR Anthony Gonzalez. In the third quarter, the Colts put the game away with Manning finding Gonzalez again on a 40-yard TD pass for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Baltimore tried a feeble comeback as QB Kyle Boller completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Devard Darling, while QB Troy Smith got a 6-yard TD run. With the win, not only did Indianapolis improve to 11-2, but they also clinched their 6th-straight playoff berth. Peyton Manning even had a record night. He became the 5th player in NFL history to throw 300 career TD passes.  At game's end, he ended up with 302 touchdown passes, surpassing John Elway for 4th place on the All-Time TD passes list.\nQuestion: How many more wins than losses did Indianapolis have after this game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 9\n\nPassage: Trying to snap a two-game skid, the 49ers stayed at home for a Saturday night interconference battle with the Cincinnati Bengals.  With QB Trent Dilfer out with an injury, back-up Shaun Hill would be making his first career start. After a scoreless first quarter, the Niners drew first blood in the second quarter as Hill got a 3-yard TD run.  However, the Bengals would take the lead as kicker Shayne Graham managed to get a 24-yard field goal, while QB Carson Palmer completed a 52-yard TD pass to WR Chris Henry.  The Niners would end the half as Hill completed a 17-yard TD pass to TE Vernon Davis. In the third quarter, San Francisco increased their lead with kicker Joe Nedney managing to get a 29-yard and a 38-yard  field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Cincinnati tried to mount a comeback as Graham kicked a 35-yard field goal.  Fortunately, the Niners' defense held on for the impressive victory. With the win, the 49ers improved to 4-10.  With the Rams' loss to the Packers, the Niners now sit in 3rd place in the NFC West.\nQuestion: How many yards was the longest touchdown pass?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 52, \n\nPassage: In 1905, 1,003 Korean immigrants, which included 802 men and 231 women and children, departed from the port of Chemulpo, Incheon aboard the ship Ilford to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, Mexico. The journey took 45 days, after which they took a train to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. In the Veracruz port, another boat was taken to the port of Progreso with the final destination being the capital city of M\u00e9rida, Yucatan. They arrived in May 1905, with previously signed contracts for four years' work as indentured laborers on the Yucat\u00e1n henequen haciendas. Many of these Koreans were distributed throughout the Yucat\u00e1n in 32 henequen haciendas. The town of Motul, Yucatan, located in the heart of the henequen zone, was a destination for many of the Korean immigrants. Subsequently, in 1909, at the end of their contracts, they began a new stage in which they scattered even further  Thus, the majority of those who came were single men who made or remade their family lives with Yucatecan especially Maya women. While Korean girls were much more subject to marriages arranged by Korean parents, males had greater freedom when it came to making a family. This rapid intermarriage by Koreans, coupled with geographic dispersal, prevented the establishment of close social networks among these migrants and therefore provided the basis for Korean descendants among the Yucatan Peninsula. After that 1905 ship, no further entries of Koreans into Mexico were recorded, until many years later, leading to a new community of Koreans with completely different characteristics from those who entered in 1905. These descendants have started the Museo Conmemorativo de la Inmigraci\u00f3n Coreana a Yucat\u00e1n, a museum for the remembrance of their ancestors journey.\nQuestion: Were there more men or women and children immigrants present?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: The Colts began their season at Reliant Stadium in an AFC South duel against the Houston Texans.  Indianapolis started the season going 3-and-out on their first offensive possession of the new year.  The Texans got good field position with a big punt return from Jacoby Jones to set up a 30-yard field goal to give them a 3-0 lead. The offense continued to struggle throughout the first half, getting two first downs on the next drive, however, eventually having to punt.  The Texans continued to show energy on both offense and defense by scoring two more time, a field goal and a touchdown, giving the Texans a 13-0 lead halfway through the second quarter.  The Colts eventually got the offense going late in the second quarter by scoring on a touchdown reception by Reggie Wayne, which broke the lead down to one possession. Adam Vinatieri made a 20-yard field goal at the end of the first half and the Colts went into the half trailing 13-10. The momentum was seemingly shifting to Indianapolis, until Houston took almost eight minutes off the third quarter clock on a 15-play drive, 13 rushes, that resulted in one of Arian Foster's rushing touchdowns on the day to give Houston a 20-10 lead. Peyton Manning and the offense struggled throughout the third quarter with missed opportunities and continued to shoot themselves in the foot with penalties.  With the start of the fourth quarter Houston scored another touchdown and broke the game open.  The Colts would eventually score two touchdowns late in the game, only when there was no chance of a comeback. With the final score 34-24, the Colts were 0-1 to start a season for the first time since 2008, when they lost to the Chicago Bears.\nQuestion: How many total points were scored?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 58, \n\nPassage: Coming off their dominating home win over the Chiefs, the Broncos flew to Reliant Stadium for a Thursday night intraconference duel with the Houston Texans.  In the first quarter, Denver trailed early as QB Sage Rosenfels got a 5-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Broncos would get on the board as kicker Jason Elam managed to get a 41-yard field goal.  Houston would respond with kicker Kris Brown getting a 41-yard field goal.  Denver would end the half with Elam nailing a 47-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Texans would increase their lead as RB Ron Dayne managed to get a 6-yard TD run.  The Broncos would respond with QB Jay Cutler completing a 12-yard TD pass to TE Tony Scheffler.  However, in the fourth quarter, Houston sealed the win as Rosenfels completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson, while FB Vonta Leach got a 1-yard TD run.\nQuestion: How many field goals over 45 yards were made?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1\n\nPassage: In 1718 the Danish claimed the island of St. John to develop sugar plantations and crops such as indigo and cotton; there was especially great demand for sugar and prices were high in Europe. Dutch planters were still important on the island. By mid-1733, planters had developed 109 plantations, and slaveholders owned more than 1,000 African slaves on St. John. One-fifth of the plantations were then devoted to sugar; by the end of the century, most would be, and the total slave population would be 2500. In 1733 the population of African slaves on St. John was more than five times larger than that of the European inhabitants: 1087 slaves and 206 whites. Many of St. John's plantations were owned by people residing on St. Thomas. These absentee landowners hired overseers to manage their lands and slaves on St. John. Under these conditions, overseer cruelty flourished. The Danish West India Company provided only six soldiers for the defense of St. John, which supplemented the local white militia.\nQuestion: How many was the minimum amount of plantations and slaves on St. John in mid-1733?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1109, \n\nPassage: In 1905, 1,003 Korean immigrants, which included 802 men and 231 women and children, departed from the port of Chemulpo, Incheon aboard the ship Ilford to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, Mexico.

The journey took 45 days, after which they took a train to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. In the Veracruz port, another boat was taken to the port of Progreso with the final destination being the capital city of M\u00e9rida, Yucatan. They arrived in May 1905, with previously signed contracts for four years' work as indentured laborers on the Yucat\u00e1n henequen haciendas. Many of these Koreans were distributed throughout the Yucat\u00e1n in 32 henequen haciendas. The town of Motul, Yucatan, located in the heart of the henequen zone, was a destination for many of the Korean immigrants. Subsequently, in 1909, at the end of their contracts, they began a new stage in which they scattered even further  Thus, the majority of those who came were single men who made or remade their family lives with Yucatecan especially Maya women. While Korean girls were much more subject to marriages arranged by Korean parents, males had greater freedom when it came to making a family. This rapid intermarriage by Koreans, coupled with geographic dispersal, prevented the establishment of close social networks among these migrants and therefore provided the basis for Korean descendants among the Yucatan Peninsula. After that 1905 ship, no further entries of Koreans into Mexico were recorded, until many years later, leading to a new community of Koreans with completely different characteristics from those who entered in 1905.

                    "Passage: Carbon County has long been considered a bellwether county for Pennsylvania statewide elections. In gubernatorial elections, it has been perfect since 1952.  At the presidential level, Carbon County was also a bellwether for Pennsylvania (although not the nation) until recently, with only 1 miss (in 1960) from 1916 to 2000, and with a margin within 3.5 points of the statewide margin in every election from 1940 to 2000 except 1964 (5.3% more Democratic) and 1976 (6.9% more Democratic). However, since then the county has trended Republican relative to the state as a whole, with McCain outperforming in Carbon by 8.5% relative to the state and Romney outperforming by 12.9%. Republicans hold the commissioner majority while Democrats hold all county row offices. Al Gore carried it in 2000, and in 2004, Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat John Kerry 49.99% to 48.81% or a margin of 296 votes.\nQuestion: How many more percent of the vote did George W. Bush get than John Kerry in 2004?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1.18\n\nPassage: The Indian Massacre of 1622 took place in the English Colony of Virginia, in what is now the United States, on Friday, 22 March 1622. John Smith, though he had not been in Virginia since 1609 and was not a first hand eyewitness, related in his History of Virginia that braves of the Powhatan \"came unarmed into our houses with deer, turkeys, fish, fruits, and other provisions to sell us\". The Powhatan grabbed any tools or weapons available and killed all English settlers they found, including men, women, and children of all ages.  Chief Opechancanough led a coordinated series of surprise attacks by the Powhatan Confederacy that killed 347 people, a quarter of the English population of the Virginia colony. Jamestown, founded in 1607, was the site of the first successful English settlement in North America, and was then the capital of the Colony of Virginia. Its tobacco economy led to constant expansion and seizure of Powhatan lands, which ultimately provoked a violent reaction.\nQuestion: How many years after John Smith had left Virginia did the Indian Massacre of 1622 take place?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 13, \n\nPassage: On 17 December 1297, the three brothers overthrew Kyawswa, and founded the Myinsaing Kingdom. At Pagan, Kyawswa's son Sawhnit was elected king by the dowager Queen Saw but soon became a governor under the authority of Myinsaing. Another of Kyawswa's sons, Kumara Kassapa, escaped to China. The Mongols did not know about the dethronement until June-July 1298. In 1300, the Myinsaing forces led by Athinkhaya attacked the Mongol garrisons north of Mandalay named Nga Singu and Male. On 22 June 1300, the Mongol Emperor declared that Kumara Kassapa was the rightful king of Burma, and sent in an army from Yunnan. The invasion force reached Myinsaing on 25 January 1301 but could not break through. The besiegers took the bribes by the three brothers, and withdrew on 6 April 1301. The Mongol government at Yunnan executed their commanders but sent no more invasions. They withdrew entirely from Upper Burma starting on 4 April 1303. By then, the city of Pagan, once home to 200,000 people, had been reduced to a small town, never to regain its preeminence.  The brothers placed one of Kyawswa's sons as the governor of Pagan. Anawrahta's line continued to rule Pagan as governors under Myinsaing, Pinya and Ava kingdoms until 1369. The male side of Pagan ended there although the female side passed into Pinya and Ava royalty. But the Pagan line continued to be claimed by successive Burmese dynasties down to the last Burmese dynasty Konbaung.\nQuestion: How many months after reaching Myinsaing did the army withdraw?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3, \n\nPassage: In 1905, 1,003 Korean immigrants, which included 802 men and 231 women and children, departed from the port of Chemulpo, Incheon aboard the ship Ilford to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, Mexico.

                    "Passage: After starting the season strongly, including a five-win run in September and October, the Chargers were beset by a string of injuries to key players, and eventually finished the season at 9-7. In contrast to 2013, the record was not enough to make the playoffs. The Chargers began the season 5\u20131, winning five straight after losing their season opener. It was followed by a three-game losing streak, and they finished 4\u20134 in the second half. They won just two of their final five games, coming back from double-digit fourth quarter deficits twice to remain in playoff contention. They lost the final game of the season when a win would have secured a playoff berth. In three of their last four games, and five of their last eight, the Chargers did not score more than one touchdown. Compared to 2013, the offense dropped in points (from 12th in the league to 17th), yards (5th to 18th), first downs (3rd to 15th), net yards per pass (2nd to 8th), rushing yards (13th to 30) and yards per rush (21st to 31st). It was the second time in three years the team finished second-to-last in yards per carry. San Diego was just 2\u20134 against teams in their division in the AFC West, and were swept by both the Denver Broncos and the Kansas City Chiefs. It was their worst intradivision record since they were 1\u20135 in 2003. The Chargers were only 3\u20136 against teams with winning records. They matched their 9\u20137 record from 2013, but missed the playoffs for the fourth time in five seasons.\nQuestion: How many winning and losing streaks did the Chargers have?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2\n\nPassage: The Dolphins entered their first game of the season with a 0-0 record, traveling to face the 0-0 Houston Texans. The game was the first start for rookie quarterback Ryan Tannehill and head coach Joe Philbin. Tannehill became the first Dolphins rookie quarterback to start the first game of the season. Entering the game the Texans are the only team the Dolphins have not beaten, holding a 0-6 record all-time against the team. Both teams moved the ball well on their opening drives, but failed to score. The Dolphins received the ball on their own 42-yard line after a missed field goal by Houston kicker Shayne Graham. After a Reggie Bush recovered fumble on 3rd down on the Houston 14-yard line the Dolphins kicker Dan Carpenter attempted and successfully executed a 39-yard field goal with (3:19) left in the first quarter. Both defenses held steady, keeping both offenses out of the redzone heading to the mid-way point of the second quarter. However, at the (7:35) point, quarterback Tannehill was intercepted by Johnathan Joseph at the 50-yard line for 36 yards. Within the shadow of their own goal posts the Dolphins held the Texans to a Shayne Graham 35-yard field goal. The interception by Tannehill was the first of his career, and marked a downhill spiral for the rest of the game. Following the score the Dolphins moved quickly to the Houston side of the field after a 10-yard rush by Reggie Bush and 32-yard pass to running back Daniel Thomas. But after a few incomplete passes, Tannehill had his pass intended for receiver Legadu Naanee deflected by a defensive lineman and intercepted by linebacker Brian Cushing with (4:06) left in the second quarter. The Texans quickly turned the turnover into points, with an Arian Foster 14-yard rush. On the first play following the Houston kickoff quarterback Tannehill again had his pass deflected by a defensive lineman, but instead was intercepted by Kareem Jackson. After a defensive pass interference penalty, running back Arian Foster rushed for his second rushing touchdown of the game at the (0:49) mark. Again following the kickoff the Dolphins again turned the ball over following a Daniel Thomas fumble. The turnover was shortly followed by a 14-yard pass touchdown from Houston quarterback Matt Schaub to receiver Andre Johnson at the (0:12) mark. Following a quick three and out by the Texans following halftime, punt returner Marcus Thigpen returned a punt for 72 yards for a touchdown. But for the remainder of the game the Dolphins offense failed to produce any scores, but held the Texans defense to two Shayne Graham field goals: 40 and 19 yards, respectively.\nQuestion: How many is the difference in the number of yards of the field goal Prater made and the number of yardsTD catch Johnson made?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 25, \n\nPassage: Beginning a stretch of three straight home games, the Patriots faced off against the 9-3 Steelers in their first afternoon game in five weeks. Before the game, Steelers safety Anthony Smith guaranteed a win for the Steelers. After going three-and-out on their first drive, the Patriots fell behind 3-0 early on a 23-yard Jeff Reed field goal to cap an 8-minute, 15-play Steelers possession. A 39-yard Chad Jackson kickoff return gave the Patriots the ball at their own 48-yard line to begin a 9-play drive that ended in a 4-yard Moss touchdown catch to give the Patriots the lead. Moss' touchdown catch was his 18th of the season, surpassing Curtis Martin for the Patriots' record for touchdowns by a single player in a season. After a Steelers three-and-out the Patriots, on their first offensive play of the second quarter, increased their lead to 14-3 on a 63-yard play action pass from Brady to Moss. A 30-yard Willie Parker run on the Steelers' ensuing series set up a 32-yard touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger to Najeh Davenport. After a Patriots drive in which a muffed punt recovery by Pittsburgh led to a missed 48-yard field goal attempt by Gostkowski, the Steelers mounted a 12-play drive that lasted almost 6&#160;minutes before a 44-yard Reed field goal cut the Patriots' lead to 14-13. With 2:29 left in the half, a 32-yard Gaffney reception helped the Patriots drive to the Steelers' 24-yard line; after two Brady incompletions Gostkowski kicked a 42-yard Gostkowski field goal, giving the Patriots a 17-13 lead at halftime. On the Patriots' first drive of the second half, on 1st and 10 from their own 44-yard line, after a Brady lateral pass to Moss fell short, Moss picked it up and threw it back to Brady, who then found Gaffney deep for a 56-yard touchdown. After another Steelers three-and-out, the Patriots' second possession of the half also went for a touchdown, as a 2-yard Welker reception capped a 10-play drive that included one run, a 4-yard Brady scramble. In the opening minutes of the fourth quarter, the Steelers moved the ball to the Patriots' 1-yard line, but failed to score on 3rd and goal and 4th and goal. The Patriots took the ball at their own 1-yard line and then began a 6-minute, 12 play drive, passing on every down. Using a no-huddle offense, Welker caught five straight passes to bring the Patriots to the Steelers' 36-yard line. Brady completed four more passes to set up first-and-goal from the Steelers' 10-yard line, but his next three passes were all incomplete, leading to a 28-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Steelers' next possession, a 13-play drive, ended in another failed fourth down conversion. After a Patriots punt, the Steelers ran the ball three times to give the Patriots their 13th win of the season; with the win, the Patriots improved to 13-0 and also clinched a first-round playoff bye.\nQuestion: How many wins do the Steelers have before the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 9, \n\nPassage: In 1905, 1,003 Korean immigrants, which included 802 men and 231 women and children, departed from the port of Chemulpo, Incheon aboard the ship Ilford to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, Mexico. The journey took 45 days, after which they took a train to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. In the Veracruz port, another boat was taken to the port of Progreso with the final destination being the capital city of M\u00e9rida, Yucatan. They arrived in May 1905, with previously signed contracts for four years' work as indentured laborers on the Yucat\u00e1n henequen haciendas. Many of these Koreans were distributed throughout the Yucat\u00e1n in 32 henequen haciendas. The town of Motul, Yucatan, located in the heart of the henequen zone, was a destination for many of the Korean immigrants. Subsequently, in 1909, at the end of their contracts, they began a new stage in which they scattered even further  Thus, the majority of those who came were single men who made or remade their family lives with Yucatecan especially Maya women. While Korean girls were much more subject to marriages arranged by Korean parents, males had greater freedom when it came to making a family. This rapid intermarriage by Koreans, coupled with geographic dispersal, prevented the establishment of close social networks among these migrants and therefore provided the basis for Korean descendants among the Yucatan Peninsula. After that 1905 ship, no further entries of Koreans into Mexico were recorded, until many years later, leading to a new community of Koreans with completely different characteristics from those who entered in 1905. These descendants have started the Museo Conmemorativo de la Inmigraci\u00f3n Coreana a Yucat\u00e1n, a museum for the remembrance of their ancestors journey.\nQuestion: Which population groups consisted of less members than the male population?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: King Ottokar II of Bohemia improved fortifications and rebuilt the royal palace for the purposes of representation and housing. In the 14th century, under the reign of Charles IV the royal palace was rebuilt in Gothic style and the castle fortifications were strengthened. In place of rotunda and basilica of St. Vitus began building of a vast Gothic church, that were completed almost six centuries later. During the Hussite Wars and the following decades, the castle was not inhabited. In 1485, King Ladislaus II Jagello began to rebuild the castle. The massive Vladislav Hall  was added to the Royal Palace. New defence towers were also built on the north side of the castle. A large fire in 1541 destroyed large parts of the castle. Under the Habsburgs, some new buildings in Renaissance style were added. Ferdinand I built the Belvedere as a summer palace for his wife Anne. Rudolph II used Prague Castle as his main residence. He founded the northern wing of the palace, with the Spanish Hall, where his precious art collections were exhibited. The Second Defenestration of Prague in 1618 took place at the castle and began the Bohemian Revolt. During the subsequent wars, the Castle was damaged and dilapidated. Many works from  the collection of Rudolph II were looted by Swedes in 1648, in the Battle of Prague  which was the final act of the Thirty Years' War. The last major rebuilding of the castle was carried out by Empress Maria Theresa in the second half of the 18th century. Following his abdication in 1848, and the succession of his nephew, Franz Joseph, to the throne, the former emperor, Ferdinand I, made Prague Castle his home.\nQuestion: How many years after King Ladislaus II Jagello began to rebuilt the castle did the castle experience a large fire?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 56, \n\nPassage: Forbes (magazine) magazine began reporting on Beyonc\u00e9s earnings in 2008, calculating that the $80 million earned between June 2007 to June 2008, for her music, tour, films and clothing line made her the worlds best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna (entertainer) and Celine Dion.

                    "Passage: According to the Secretary of State of California, as of October 22, 2012, Solano County has 209,484 registered voters, out of 274,284 eligible (76.4%). Of those, 101,815 (48.6%) are registered Democrats, 52,777 (25.2%) are registered California Republican Party, and 45,581 (21.8%) have Decline to State a political party. Democrats hold voter-registration advantages in all incorporated cities and towns in Solano County. However, Republicans lead in registration in the unincorporated communities of the county (40%-35%), making Solano the only county in the Bay Area where Republicans out-number Democrats in unincorporated communities. The Democrats largest registration advantage in Solano is in the city of Vallejo, California, wherein there are only 8,242 Republicans (14.6%) out of 56,313 total voters compared to 33,753 Democrats (59.9%) and 12,157 voters who have declined to state a political party (21.6%).\nQuestion: How many less percentage did the Republicans have than Democrats in Vallejo California?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 45.3\n\nPassage: Coming off their bye week, the Vikings flew to New Meadowlands Stadium for a Week 5 interconference duel with the New York Jets on Monday night. Minnesota trailed early in the first quarter as Jets kicker Nick Folk got a 25-yard field goal. The Vikings' deficit increased in the second quarter as Folk made a 53-yard and a 22-yard field goal. Minnesota's frustrations continued in the third quarter as Folk got a 34-yard field goal. The Vikings would respond as quarterback Brett Favre threw his 500th career touchdown pass by finding wide receiver Randy Moss on a 37-yard touchdown pass, but New York answered with Folk's 31-yard field goal. After the delay at the end of the third quarter due to adverse weather conditions the Vikings would strike back in the fourth quarter as Favre found wide receiver Percy Harvin on a 34-yard touchdown pass (with a failed 2-point conversion), but the Jets replied with a 23-yard touchdown run from running back Shonn Greene. Minnesota tried to rally as Favre found Harvin again on an 11-yard touchdown pass, but New York would put the game away as cornerback Dwight Lowery returned an interception 26 yards for a touchdown.\nQuestion: How many yards was Folk's longest field goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 53, \n\nPassage: Mike Evans caught two touchdown passes from Mike Glennon, as Tampa Bay led 17-16 in the fourth quarter. Cleveland scored with 8:59 remaining in regulation, and won the game by the score of 22-17. In the final two minutes, Tampa Bay drove to the Cleveland 28 yard line, but an offensive pass interference penalty pushed them back to the 47. Facing 4th down & 11, Glennon's pass was incomplete, and the Browns defeated Tampa Bay for the first time since 1995.\nQuestion: Which team was leading the game by the fourth quarter?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Tampa Bay led 17-16, in the fourth quarter, \n\nPassage: The institutional framework of Navarre was preserved following the 1512 invasion. Once Ferdinand II of Aragon died in January, the Parliament of Navarre gathered in Pamplona, urging Charles V  to attend a coronation ceremony in the town following tradition, but the envoys of the Parliament were met with the Emperor's utter indifference if not contempt. He refused to attend any ceremony and responded with a brief \"let's say I am happy and  pleases me.\" Eventually the Parliament met in 1517 without Charles V, represented instead by the Duke of Najera pronouncing an array of promises of little certitude, while the acting Parliament kept piling up grievances and demands for damages due to the Emperor, totalling 67\u2014the 2nd Viceroy of Navarre Fadrique de Acu\u00f1a was deposed in 1515 probably for acceding to send grievances.:39-40 Contradictions inherent to the documents accounting for the Emperor's non-existent oath pledge in 1516 point to a contemporary manipulation of the records.\nQuestion: Who died second: Ferdinand II or Charles V?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: Coming off their divisional road win over the Panthers, the Saints went home for a Week 13 NFC South rematch with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  In the first quarter, New Orleans trailed early with Buccaneers kicker Matt Bryant getting a 27-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Saints took the lead with QB Drew Brees completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Terrance Copper.  In the second quarter, Tampa Bay regained the lead with QB Luke McCown completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Anthony Becht, along with Bryant nailing a 31-yard field goal.  Afterwards, New Orleans retook the lead with Brees completing a 45-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson. In the third quarter, the Buccaneers regained the lead with RB Earnest Graham getting a 25-yard TD run.  Later, the Saints retook the lead with CB Mike McKenzie returning an interception 53 yards for a touchdown.  In the fourth quarter, New Orleans increased its lead with DE Will Smith taking McCown down in his endzone for a safety.  However, an attempted double reverse resulted in a lost fumble.  It would allow Tampa Bay to get into position for the win, as McCown completed a 4-yard TD pass to TE Jerramy Stevens.\nQuestion: How many yards was the longest touchdown pass?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 45, \n\nPassage: On 12 January 1918, Parliament authorised the Svinhufvud Senate to establish internal order and discipline on behalf of the state. On 15 January, Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, a former Finnish general of the Imperial Russian Army, was appointed the commander-in-chief of the Civil Guards. The Senate appointed the Guards, henceforth called the White Guards, as the White Army of Finland. Mannerheim placed his Headquarters of the White Army in the Vaasa-Sein\u00e4joki area. The White Order to engage was issued on 25 January. The Whites gained weaponry by disarming Russian garrisons during 21-28 January, in particular in southern Ostrobothnia. The Red Guards, led by Ali Aaltonen, refused to recognise the Whites' hegemony and established a military authority of their own. Aaltonen installed his headquarters in Helsinki and nicknamed it Smolna echoing the Smolny Institute, the Bolsheviks' headquarters in Petrograd. The Red Order of Revolution was issued on 26 January, and a red lantern, a symbolic indicator of the uprising, was lit in the tower of the Helsinki Workers' House. A large-scale mobilisation of the Reds began late in the evening of 27 January, with the Helsinki Red Guard and some of the Guards located along the Vyborg-Tampere railway having been activated between 23 and 26 January, in order to safeguard vital positions and escort a heavy railroad shipment of Bolshevik weapons from Petrograd to Finland. White troops tried to capture the shipment: 20-30 Finns, Red and White, died in the Battle of K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4 at the Karelian Isthmus on 27 January 1918. The Finnish rivalry for power had culminated.\nQuestion: How many days passed during this event?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 15, \n\nPassage: In 1545, Polin was on his way to fight against the English in the area of Boulogne. While in Marseilles in 1545, Polin was involved as a leader in the massacre of the Protestant Waldensians . Outside the Piedmont the Waldenses joined the local Protestant churches in Bohemia, France and Germany. After they came out of clandestinity and reports were made of sedition on their part, the French king, Francis I issued on 1 January 1545 the \"Arr\u00eat de M\u00e9rindol\", and armed a crusade against the Waldensians of Provence. The leaders in the 1545 massacres were Jean Maynier d'Opp\u00e8de, First President of the parlement of Provence, and Antoine Escalin des Aimars who was returning from the Italian Wars with 2,000 veterans, the Bandes de Pi\u00e9mont. Deaths ranged from hundreds to thousands, depending on the estimates, and several villages were devastated.\nQuestion: Who were the leaders of the 1545 massacres?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Jean Maynier d'Opp\u00e8de, Antoine Escalin des Aimars, \n\nPassage: The institutional framework of Navarre was preserved following the 1512 invasion.

In 1945, the Japanese issued a 1,000 Pesos note. This set of new money, which was printed even before the war, became known in the Philippines as Mickey Mouse money due to its very low value caused by severe inflation. Anti-Japanese newspapers portrayed stories of going to the market laden with suitcases or \"bayong\" (native bags made of woven coconut or Corypha leaf strips) overflowing with the Japanese-issued bills. In 1944, a box of matches cost more than 100 Mickey Mouse pesos. In 1945, a kilogram of camote cost around 1000 Mickey Mouse pesos.

                    "Passage: The Steelers stayed home for a 3-game home stand and for a Sunday Night duel against the Ravens.  The Ravens scored first when Joe Flacco hooked up with Torrey Smith 35-yard TD pass to take a 7-0 lead for the only score of the first quarter.  In the 2nd quarter, the Steelers managed to tie the game up when Ben Roethlisberger found Le'Veon Bell on a 5-yard TD pass for a 7-7 game.  They eventually took the lead when Roethlisberger found Martavis Bryant on a 19-yard TD pass to make it a 14-7 game.  The Ravens came within 4 as Justin Tucker kicked a 46-yard field goal to make it 14-10 game.  However, the Steelers would manage to go ahead by 12 before halftime when Roethlisberger found Markus Wheaton on a 47-yard TD pass followed by a successful 2-point conversion for a 22-10 lead at halftime.  After a scoreless 3rd quarter, the Steelers came out strong and went back to work in the 4th when Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 54-yard TD pass making the score 29-10.  The Ravens responded with a big play as Jacoby Jones ran a 108-yard kickoff return for a TD to make it a 29-17 game. Roethlisberger found Bryant again on an 18-yard TD pass to make the score 36-17.  This was followed by the Ravens trying their hand at coming back when Flacco found Crockett Gillmore on a 1-yard TD pass (with a failed 2-point conversion) for a 36-23 score.  But the Steelers were able to seal the game when Roethlisberger found Matt Spaeth on a 33-yard TD pass for a final score of 43-23. A week after passing for a franchise-record six touchdowns against Indianapolis, Roethlisberger duplicated the feat to lead Pittsburgh to its third consecutive win. The 12 touchdown passes over the last two games broke the NFL record of 11 set by Tom Flores for Oakland in the AFL in 1963 and matched by New England's Tom Brady in 2007.\nQuestion: Who caught the shortest touchdown pass?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Crockett Gillmore\n\nPassage: In the county, the population was spread out with 23.00% under the age of 18, 9.40% from 18 to 24, 26.80% from 25 to 44, 25.20% from 45 to 64, and 15.60% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females there were 96.70 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.00 males.\nQuestion: How many in percent weren't 18 to 24?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 90.6\n\nPassage: For the second straight week, the Jets would not score a touchdown, as they managed only 3 points in a 23-3 loss to Miami. Geno Smith did not start in this game, as he was benched and replaced by Matt Simms. Simms would not do much of a better job, as he, like Smith, failed to throw a touchdown pass. Smith would come in later on, but would only go 4 for 10 throwing the ball and ended with a passer rating of 8.3. With the loss, the Jets fell to 5-7.\nQuestion: Who was 23-3\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: the Jets, \n\nPassage: The first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos. The next year brought \"replacement notes\" of the 1, 5 and 10 Pesos while 1944 ushered in a 100 Peso note and soon after an inflationary 500 Pesos note. In 1945, the Japanese issued a 1,000 Pesos note. This set of new money, which was printed even before the war, became known in the Philippines as Mickey Mouse money due to its very low value caused by severe inflation. Anti-Japanese newspapers portrayed stories of going to the market laden with suitcases or \"bayong\" (native bags made of woven coconut or Corypha leaf strips) overflowing with the Japanese-issued bills. In 1944, a box of matches cost more than 100 Mickey Mouse pesos. In 1945, a kilogram of camote cost around 1000 Mickey Mouse pesos. Inflation plagued the country with the devaluation of the Japanese money, evidenced by a 60% inflation experienced in January 1944.\nQuestion: How many different denominations of centavos were there in 1942?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: Coming off their win over the Cardinals the Chargers flew to Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum for an AFC West division rivalry match against the Raiders. In the first quarter the Chargers' offense had problems when after a three-and-out Mike Scifres' punt was blocked by RB Rock Cartwright out of bounds in the end zone for a safety. Then kicker Sebastian Janikowski made a 50-yard field goal. Then Scifres' punt was blocked again and returned by FS Hiram Eugene 5&#160;yards to the endzone for a touchdown. The Chargers then fought back and took the lead with QB Philip Rivers completing a 19-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates. Then RB Mike Tolbert got a 4-yard TD run. Then the Chargers trailed with Janikowski making a 30-yard field goal. But they responded and got the lead back with kicker Nate Kaeding making a 43-yard field goal, followed in the third quarter by Rivers making a 41-yard TD pass to WR Malcolm Floyd. The Raiders replied with QB Jason Campbell completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Zach Miller. Followed in the 4th quarter by Kaeding making a 34-yard field goal. The Chargers fell behind when RB Michael Bush got a 3-yard touchdown run (with a failed 2-point conversion), followed by SS Tyvon Branch recovering a fumble and running 64&#160;yards to the endzone for a touchdown to give the Chargers a loss, for the first time against the Raiders since 2003. With the loss, San Diego fell to 2-3 for the 4th straight season.\nQuestion: Who threw the longest touchdown pass?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Rivers, \n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Browns, the Ravens flew to Bill Walsh Field at Monster Park for an interconference duel with the San Francisco 49ers. Baltimore would even go up against the QB that helped them win Super Bowl XXXV, Trent Dilfer, because QB Alex Smith was out with a separated shoulder. After a scoreless first quarter, the Ravens got the first punch with kicker Matt Stover getting a 26-yard and a 32-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Stover gave Baltimore a 49-yard field goal. However, the 49ers threatened with Dilfer completing a 23-yard TD pass to WR Arnaz Battle. The 49ers' kicker Joe Nedney missed the potential game-winning field goal from 52 yards out, and the Ravens held on for the lead.\nQuestion: How many field goals did Matt Stover kick?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3\n\nPassage: Fresh off their dominating win over the Jaguars, the Seahawks stayed at home for a Week 6 NFC West duel with the Arizona Cardinals. Seattle would trail in the first quarter as Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald, followed by running back Tim Hightower's 2-yard touchdown run. Arizona would increase its lead in the second quarter with a 29-yard field goal from kicker Neil Rackers. The Seahawks would then get on the board as kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 28-yard field goal. However, the Cardinals took control in the second half as Warner found wide receiver Steve Breaston on a 16-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter, followed by Rackers' 31-yard field goal in the fourth.

                    "Passage: Coming off an impressive divisional road win over the Cardinals, the 49ers flew to Bank of America Stadium for a Week 13 intraconference game with the Carolina Panthers. In the first quarter, the Niners trailed early as Panthers kicker John Kasay nailing a 19-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, San Francisco continued to struggle as Carolina QB Vinny Testaverde completed a 5-yard to TE Dante Rosario, along with CB Richard Marshall returning an interception 67 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter, the Niners managed to get on the board with QB Trent Dilfer completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Arnaz Battle and 21-yard TD pass to TE Delanie Walker. Afterwards, the Panthers replied with RB DeShaun Foster getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Carolina sealed the win with Testaverde completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Jeff King. With the loss, not only did the 49ers drop to 3-9, it guaranteed them their fifth consecutive losing season since San Francisco's last playoff appearance in 2002.\nQuestion: How many more touchdowns were there in the second half compared to the first half\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2\n\nPassage: After the rise of Young Turks to power through their 1908 revolution, they began imposing a more centralized system of rule across the Ottoman Empire. This meant to put an end to local particularism, which was seen first in the violent suppression of the Hauran Druze Rebellion in Syria in 1909. During the Syrian rebellion, the Ottomans succeeded in suppressing the Jabal Druze revolt after conquering the villages, forcibly registering villagers and disarming them, collecting taxes in cash or cattle, and conscripting 1000 men into the Ottoman army. Ottoman governor Sami Pasha al-Faruqi wanted to apply same measures in Transjordan: villages in Ajlun were encircled by 400 Ottoman soldiers who disarmed the villagers and took 85 conscripts. Governmental troops in Al-Salt and Madaba issued identity papers as a prelude to conscription. Sami Pasha sent a telegram on 6 November 1910 from Jabal Druze to the Al-Karak Mutasarr\u0131f Muhemet Tahir Pasha, requesting that the residents of the town demonstrate their loyalty to the Empire by ceding their weapons and submitting to personal registration. This was seen differently by the local population; measures of disarmament and conscription. The Mutasarr\u0131f conveyed the message to the residents, who responded by requesting that they be allowed to keep their weapons for protection against Bedouin raiders. Sami Pasha assured them that the state would only conduct registration of people and lands but sent a large number of troops into the area, undermining his credibility.\nQuestion: What event happened first, the Hauran Druze Rebellion or troops conscripting villagers?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Hauran Druze Rebellion, \n\nPassage: In week 5, the Lions hosted the defending Super Bowl Champion Pittsburgh Steelers. The Lions scored first with a 46-yard Jason Hanson field goal. The Steelers responded with a 7-yard TD run by Rashard Mendenhall. The Lions replied with another 46-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Pittsburgh scored first with a 15-yard TD catch by Heath Miller from Ben Roethlisberger. The Lions retaliated with a 38-yard interception run for a touchdown by William James. Hines Ward of the Steelers next got a touchdown of his own, a 17-yard catch, making the halftime score 21-13 Pittsburgh. After the break, Mike Wallace of Pittsburgh caught a 47-yard TD pass. The final score of the game was a 25-yard catch by Detroit's Dennis Northcutt. Lions backup QB Daunte Culpepper was sacked 7 times in the loss, 3 of which were on consecutive downs.\nQuestion: How many total points did the Pacers score in the first two games?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 194\n\nPassage: The first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos. The next year brought \"replacement notes\" of the 1, 5 and 10 Pesos while 1944 ushered in a 100 Peso note and soon after an inflationary 500 Pesos note. In 1945, the Japanese issued a 1,000 Pesos note. This set of new money, which was printed even before the war, became known in the Philippines as Mickey Mouse money due to its very low value caused by severe inflation. Anti-Japanese newspapers portrayed stories of going to the market laden with suitcases or \"bayong\" (native bags made of woven coconut or Corypha leaf strips) overflowing with the Japanese-issued bills. In 1944, a box of matches cost more than 100 Mickey Mouse pesos. In 1945, a kilogram of camote cost around 1000 Mickey Mouse pesos. Inflation plagued the country with the devaluation of the Japanese money, evidenced by a 60% inflation experienced in January 1944.\nQuestion: What year were the replacement notes of the 1, 5 and 10 pesos issued?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: So many questions surrounded the Dallas Cowboys as they entered Week 3. With no Dez Bryant or Tony Romo, how would the rest of the team respond? Coach Jason Garrett's mantra of \"next man up\" played a big part in preparing for the game against the Atlanta Falcons. Backup quarterback Brandon Weeden started for the first time since last season against the Arizona Cardinals, but this outing was much different. He completed 22 of 26 passes for 232 yards. Although he threw one interception and had zero touchdowns, the loss could not be blamed on him alone. The Cowboys played very well in the first half, outscoring the Falcons 28-17; however, the Falcons made a few halftime adjustments that squashed any running game the Cowboys pursued. On the other hand, the Cowboys had no answer for Julio Jones, who ran 164 yards and had 2 touchdowns.  Owner Jerry Jones said after the game that the Cowboys just looked tired in the second half. In typical fashion for this season, the Falcons came back late in the third quarter and won the game 39-28.\nQuestion: how many passes did weeden complete?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 22, \n\nPassage: Between 1911 and 1912, over 1,000 Somalis from Mogadishu, the then capital of Italian Somaliland, served as combat units along with Eritrean and Italian soldiers in the Italo-Turkish War. Most of the troops stationed never returned home until they were transferred back to Italian Somaliland in preparation for the invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. The first disembarkation of Italian troops occurred on October 10. The Italian contingent of 20,000 troops was deemed sufficient to accomplish the conquest at the time. Tobruk, Derna and Khoms were easily conquered, but the same was not true for Benghazi. The first true setback for the Italian troops happened on October 23, when poor placement of the troops near Tripoli led them to be almost completely encircled by more mobile Arab cavalry, backed by some Turkish regular units. The attack was portrayed as a simple revolt by the Italian press, but it nearly annihilated much of the small Italian expeditionary corps. The corps was consequently enlarged to 100,000 men who had to face 20,000 Arabs and 8,000 Turks. The war turned into one of position.  Even some of the earliest examples of utilisation in modern warfare of armoured cars and air power by the Italian forces had little effect on the initial outcome. However, the war was notable for the first military use of heavier-than-air craft. Capitano Carlo Piazza flew the first military reconnaissance flight on 23 October 1911. A week later, Sottotenente Giulio Gavotti dropped four grenades on Taguira and Ain Zara in history's first aerial bombing.\nQuestion: In the Italo-Turkish War who was the difficult to conquer for the Italians, Tobruk, Derna, Khoms or Benghazi?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Benghazi, \n\nPassage: The Browns began the season with a division game against the Cincinnati Bengals. The Bengals struck first, with two Mike Nugent field goals and a Jermaine Gresham touchdown reception. Down 13-0, the Browns struck back, with Colt McCoy completing two touchdown passes to give Cleveland the lead at halftime. Phil Dawson gave the Browns an insurance field goal, but late in the fourth, Bengals backup QB Bruce Gradkowski caught the Browns defense slow out of the huddle and hit A. J. Green for a 41-yard touchdown that proved to be the game winner. With the 27-17 loss, the Browns started the season 0-1.\nQuestion: Which teams scored the first 13 points?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Cincinnati Bengals, \n\nPassage: The first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos.

                    "Passage: In an attempt to break a three-game losing streak the Titans flew to Reliant Stadium for an AFC South rivalry match against the Texans. The Titans trailed throughout the game as QB Matt Schaub got a 1-yard TD pass to TE Joel Dreessen, followed by his 2-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson. The lead was increased when kicker Neil Rackers hit a 35 and a 33-yard field goal. With 7:53 remaining in the 4th quarter, an altercation between Texans WR Andre Johnson and Titans CB Cortland Finnegan broke out, causing both players to be ejected for the rest of the game. Both players' helmets were torn off, then punches were exchanged in return. Despite being ejected, they avoided suspension, but were each fined $25,000 for their actions. With the shut-out loss, not only did the Titans fall to 5-6, but this also became their 3rd straight season being shut out on the road.\nQuestion: How many yards was Matt Schaub's longest touchdown pass?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2, \n\nPassage: The Texans never punted during the first half, with four drives ending in a touchdown and one in a 50-yard field goal from Ka'imi Fairbairn. On Houston's last possession of the half, a Deshaun Watson pass was intercepted by Kevin Byard. Andre Hal intercepted two Marcus Mariota passes during the half. The Texans' first punt came on their second possession of the second half, with 3:27 left in the 3rd quarter. The 30 points scored in the first half are the second most in franchise history. Houston defeated Tennessee by a score of 57-14, the most points scored in a single game in franchise history.\nQuestion: Which player had the most interceptions?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Andre Hal, \n\nPassage: Coming off their road win over the Bears, the Patriots returned home for a game with the Green Bay Packers. After Green Bay recovered their own opening kick-off onside kick, they marched to the Patriots 7, but on 2nd-and-6, Eugene Moore sacked  Matt Flynn was sacked for a 6-yard loss, and after an incomplete pass on 3rd-and-12, settled for a 31-yard field goal by Mason Crosby. The Patriots countered, racing 73 yards in 7 plays, and scoring on a 33-yard touchdown run by Green-Ellis. Two possessions later, on the third play of the Packers drive, Flynn hit James Jones for a 66-yard touchdown bomb on the first play of the second quarter, giving the Packers a 10-7 lead. Three possessions later, the Packers marched 82 yards in six-and-a-half minutes, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown pass from Flynn to Greg Jennings, giving them a very surprising 17-7 lead late in the first half, but the momentum instantly swung back to New England. Offensive lineman Dan Connolly returned the squib kick 71 yards to 3 yard line. Three plays later, Brady threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Hernandez, trimming the deficit to 17-14 at halftime. The Packers receive the 2nd half kickoff and on the fourth play of their first possession, Arrington intercepted a short pass from Flynn and returned it 36 yards for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a 21-17 lead. After Sam Shields returned the ensuing kickoff 21 yards to the 31, the Packers countered, engineering a 13-play, 69-yard drive, taking just under six minutes off the clock, and scoring on a 6-yard touchdown pass from Flynn to John Kuhn, re-taking the lead 24-21. B. J. Raji ended the Patriots next drive with a 10-yard sack of Brady on 3rd-and-9. Set up with tremendous field position at their own 46, the Packers drove to the Patriots 1-yard line, but couldn't get in on two consecutive plays, and settled for a 19-yard field goal by Crosby, increasing the lead to 27-21, but keeping the Patriots in the game. The Patriots seemed primed to make the Packers regret their red zone mistake, reaching the Packers 20, but could only trim the deficit to 27-24 on a 38-yard field goal by Graham. After a Packers three-and-out, the Patriots raced 63 yards in 6 plays, not facing a single third-down, scoring on 10-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Hernandez, giving them a 31-27 lead. The Packers looked finished after punting with less than five minutes remaining, but after forcing the Patriots to a three-and-out, the Packers took over at their own 43 with 4:22 remaining, and once last chance to pull off the stunning upset. The Packers drove to the Patriots 24, but Fletcher sacked Flynn for a costly 8 yard loss. After back-to-back completions to Jones and Donald Driver for gains of 7 and 10 yards, respectively, the Packers faced a 4th-and-1 at the Patriots 15, but Banta-Cain strip-sacked Flynn and Wilfork recovered and the Patriots escaped with the win. With the win, the Patriots improved to 12-2. It was Brady's seventh consecutive game with at least two touchdowns without an interception, breaking Don Meredith's 1965-1966 record of six such games. Brady attempted 24 passes and his streak of consecutive pass attempts without an interception was extended to 292-3rd longest all-time, behind only Bernie Kosar's 308 (1990-91), and Bart Starr's 294 (1964-65). Brady did break the single season record also held by Kosar. Upon defeating the Packers on Sunday Night, every NFC team has now accumulated at least one loss at Gillette Stadium during its first nine years of existence. Also, for the fourth time in six games, the Patriots scored at least 31 points against a top-10 defense, winning every game.\nQuestion: How many losses did the Patriots have before the game started?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2, \n\nPassage: The first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos. The next year brought \"replacement notes\" of the 1, 5 and 10 Pesos while 1944 ushered in a 100 Peso note and soon after an inflationary 500 Pesos note. In 1945, the Japanese issued a 1,000 Pesos note. This set of new money, which was printed even before the war, became known in the Philippines as Mickey Mouse money due to its very low value caused by severe inflation. Anti-Japanese newspapers portrayed stories of going to the market laden with suitcases or \"bayong\" (native bags made of woven coconut or Corypha leaf strips) overflowing with the Japanese-issued bills. In 1944, a box of matches cost more than 100 Mickey Mouse pesos. In 1945, a kilogram of camote cost around 1000 Mickey Mouse pesos. Inflation plagued the country with the devaluation of the Japanese money, evidenced by a 60% inflation experienced in January 1944.\nQuestion: How many denominations existed for centavos in 1942?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

In the first quarter, things looked bad as Matt Ryan was sacked, injured his toe, and got taken out of the game as his back-up Chris Redman got on the field. In the second quarter, the Falcons drew first blood as kicker Jason Elam nailed a 45-yard field goal. Atlanta extended their lead as Redman threw a shovel pass to Jerious Norwood for a 22-yard touchdown. Tampa Bay responded with Josh Freeman's 42-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Bryant and tied the game at halftime with Connor Barth's 39-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Bucs safety Corey Lynch blocked a Falcons punt, which set Freeman up for an 8-yard touchdown pass to running back Carnell Williams to take the lead. The Falcons struck back as Elam nailed a 37-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Bucs punter Dirk Johnson faked a play which was backfired. Several plays later, Elam attempted a 43-yard field goal, but he missed as it went too much to the left. The same happened with Bucs kicker Barth as he missed a 51-yard field goal attempt. Atlanta was facing fourth and goal with 26 seconds remaining and no timeouts left, as Redman connected with Roddy White for a 5-yard touchdown pass. With the win, the Falcons improved to 6-5. It was later revealed that Matt Ryan would miss out several weeks.\nQuestion: Which player cored the first points of the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Jason Elam\n\nPassage: Coming off their road win over the Browns, the Titans flew to Heinz Field for a Week 5 intraconference duel with the Pittsburgh Steelers.  Tennessee threw the game's opening punch in the first quarter with a 29-yard field goal from kicker Rob Bironas, but the Steelers answered with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completing an 8-yard touchdown pass to tight end Heath Miller.  Pittsburgh added onto their lead in the second with Roethlisberger completing a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Hines Ward and a 1-yard touchdown pass to fullback David Johnson. The Steelers continued their dominating performance in the third quarter with Roethlisberger completing a 5-yard touchdown pass to Ward.  The Titans would respond with a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Chris Johnson, yet Pittsburgh came right back in the fourth quarter with kicker Shaun Suisham getting a 19-yard field goal.  Tennessee tried to rally as quarterback Matt Hasselbeck found wide receiver Damian Williams on a 19-yard touchdown pass, but the Steelers closed out the game with Roethlisberger completing a 40-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mike Wallace.\nQuestion: Who had the longest touchdown reception?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Mike Wallace\n\nPassage: The first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos.

                    "Passage: Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Jets, the Texans flew to LP Field for a Week 2 divisional battle with the Tennessee Titans.  Houston would trail early in the first quarter as Titans running back Chris Johnson got a 57-yard touchdown run.  The Texans would respond with quarterback Matt Schaub completing a 19-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Andre Johnson, but Tennessee replied with quarterback Kerry Collins completing a 69-yard touchdown to Johnson.  The Titans would add onto their lead in the second quarter as Collins completed an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Nate Washington.  Afterwards, Houston would take the lead as Schaub completed a 72-yard touchdown pass to Johnson and a 29-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jacoby Jones, along with kicker Kris Brown making a 38-yard field goal.  Tennessee would tie the game to end the half as kicker Rob Bironas made a 40-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Titans got their lead again as Johnson got a 91-yard touchdown run.  Afterwards, the Texans would tie the game as Schaub completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Owen Daniels.  In the fourth quarter, Houston would take the lead as Brown nailed a 23-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the defense prevented Tennessee from rallying. With the win, the Texans improved to 1-1.  It was the first road win against Tennessee since 2004.\nQuestion: How many touchdowns were scored during the first half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 6\n\nPassage: Trying to rebound from their road loss to the Eagles, the Lions went home for an NFC North duel with the defending NFC champion Chicago Bears. In the first quarter, Detroit drew first blood with kicker Jason Hanson nailing a 49-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  However, in the second quarter, the Bears took the lead with QB Brian Griese (Rex Grossman was benched prior to the game) completing a 15-yard TD pass to WR Muhsin Muhammad for the only score of the period.  In the third quarter, Chicago increased its lead with kicker Robbie Gould getting a 49-yard and a 41-yard field goal. Afterwards, a high-flying fourth quarter began with QB Jon Kitna completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Shaun McDonald, along with DB Keith Smith returning an interception 64 yards for a touchdown, giving the Lions the lead.  However, the Bears regained the lead with WR/KR/PR Devin Hester returning a kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown.  Fortunately, Detroit retook the lead with Kitna completing a 15-yard TD pass to WR Troy Edwards, along with RB Kevin Jones getting a 5-yard TD pass.  Chicago would get close with Griese completing a 1-yard TD pass to WR Bernard Berrian.  Afterwards, the Lions sealed their impressive victory with TE Casey Fitzsimmons returning an onside kick 41 yards for a touchdown. The Lions' 34 points would be the most fourth quarter points in NFL history. There was a combined total of 48 points in the fourth quarter, also an NFL record.\nQuestion: How many touchdowns of over 40 yards were scored in the fourth quarter?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3\n\nPassage: In 2000, there were 149,957 households out of which 18.30% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 52.70% were Marriage living together, 7.70% had a female householder with no husband present, and 37.00% were non-families. 30.40% of all households were made up of individuals and 16.90% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.13 and the average family size was 2.61.\nQuestion: Which group for households is larger: Marriage living together or non-families?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Marriage living together\n\nPassage: The first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos. The next year brought \"replacement notes\" of the 1, 5 and 10 Pesos while 1944 ushered in a 100 Peso note and soon after an inflationary 500 Pesos note. In 1945, the Japanese issued a 1,000 Pesos note. This set of new money, which was printed even before the war, became known in the Philippines as Mickey Mouse money due to its very low value caused by severe inflation. Anti-Japanese newspapers portrayed stories of going to the market laden with suitcases or \"bayong\" (native bags made of woven coconut or Corypha leaf strips) overflowing with the Japanese-issued bills. In 1944, a box of matches cost more than 100 Mickey Mouse pesos. In 1945, a kilogram of camote cost around 1000 Mickey Mouse pesos. Inflation plagued the country with the devaluation of the Japanese money, evidenced by a 60% inflation experienced in January 1944.\nQuestion: How many new Peso notes were presented in 1944?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

In the first quarter the 49ers took the early lead with QB Alex Smith making a 12-yard TD pass to TE Vernon Davis. Then DB Taylor Mays recovered a blocked punt in the endzone for a touchdown. Then the Falcons rallied with QB Matt Ryan completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Harry Douglas. Then the Falcons took the lead with three field goals from kicker Matt Bryant. He made a 37-yard field goal near the end of the 2nd quarter, a 31-yard field goad in the 3rd.  Late in the 4th quarter, CB Nate Clements intercepted Matt Ryan's pass which should have sealed the game for the 49ers who were then up 14 - 13.

                    "Passage: Playing in hot, humid Florida weather, the Giants scored on their first possession for the third week in a row. Jacobs' 6-yard run was also the Giants' first red zone touchdown in eight trips this year. After that, the Giants never looked back. They held the Buccaneers to 18 total yards of offense and 0 first downs in the first half. Smith contributed with a 4-yard touchdown catch on the first play of the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, Sinorice Moss' first reception of the year was good for an 18-yard touchdown. The game ended with David Carr at quarterback for the Giants and Josh Johnson relieving Tampa Bay quarterback Byron Leftwich, whom the Giants' defense held to just 22 passing yards on the day. The Giants had pitched their first shutout on the road since 1983.\nQuestion: How many catches did Sinorice Moss have?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1, \n\nPassage: Immediately, the Capetian family reacted. On 5 January 1242, Count Alphonse of Poiters called together the Poitevin nobles at Chinon for Easter. The faithful lords, and others less loyal but nonetheless enemies of Lusignan, responded to the appeal.  Although his mother Blanche of Castile had coped with baronial uprisings before and carried on the royal affairs since 1226, with the title \"baillistre\" , Louis IX decided to go to the assistance of his brother and forcibly take control of the County of La Marche. In April 1242, Louis assembled a force at Chinon that some contemporaries estimated at around 50,000. On 9 May, he marched against the castle of Montreuil-Bonnin, the fortress of Lusignan. After having seizing a multitude of rebel castles, he steered towards Saintes. On 20 May 1242, Henry and Richard departed Portsmouth for Royan and joined the rebelling French nobles, forming an army that may have numbered about 30,000. The two kings exchanged letters, but these resolved nothing. Henry had intentions to regain the past Angevin Empire of his predecessors on the basis that the title of Count of Poitou stills belonged to his brother, Richard. This was not the first war that Henry had waged in France either as he had earlier lead an expedition to France in 1230, however, Henry was convinced that Hugh would provide the necessary support to reverse the lackluster results of the last war. While completing his conquest of lower Poitou, he declared war on Saint Louis on 16 July. On 20 July, the French army arrived at Taillebourg where the inevitable clash took place.\nQuestion: Who was born last: Blanche of Castile or Count Alphonse of Poiters?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Count Alphonse of Poiters, \n\nPassage: Following their home game in Mexico, the Raiders returned to Oakland to face the Carolina Panthers. The Raiders were looking to extend their winning streak to five games, the longest streak since their Super Bowl season of 2002. Things started well as the Raiders defense held the Panthers to a three-and-out series and the Raiders offense moved right down the field. Seth Roberts caught a two-yard pass from Derek Carr to put the Raiders up 7-0. The Panthers answered on a three-yard touchdown run by Cam Newton to tie the score. The rest of the first half belonged to the Raiders as Latavius Murray scored from four yards out and Sebastian Janikowski kicked a 23-yard field goal to put the Raiders up 17-7. The Panther took over with 1:56 remaining in the second quarter looking to cut the Raider lead, but Khalil Mack made an acrobatic catch of Newton pass and returned it six yards for another Raider touchdown. The Panthers took a knee on the final possession of the half as the Raiders held a 24-7 lead. On the second play of the third quarter, Carr injured the pinky finger of his throwing hand on an awkward snap. The play resulted in a fumble recovered by the Panthers. Six plays later, Jonathan Stewart scored from one-yard out to cut the lead to 24-13 after the extra point was blocked. With Carr in the locker room tending to his injured finger, Matt McGloin took over for the Raiders, but they could not muster any offense and were forced to punt. Newton then hit Ted Ginn Jr. on an 88-yard pass and catch to put the Panthers with five. The Panthers opted to go for two points, but failed and, therefore, trailed 24-19. Carr returned to the game with a glove on this throwing hand on the next possession, but after completing two passes, Carr was intercepted by Thomas Davis. The Panthers continued their hot start to the half as Stewart scored his second rushing touchdown of the game. The Panthers again failed on their two-point conversion, but now held the lead, 25-24. Following three straight incompletions by Carr, the Panters took over and extended the lead on a 44-yard pass from Newton to Kelvin Benjamin. Now trailing 32-24, the Raiders answered on a 10-play drive capped off by a Clive Walford 12-yard touchdown reception. The two point conversion was good on a Carr pass to Roberts and the game was tied at 32. The Raiders defense forced a punt by the Panthers and the Raiders took over with 5:05 remaining in the game. The Raiders 12-play drive stalled at the Carolina six-yard line, but Janikowski hit his second field goal of the game to give the Raiders a 35-32 lead. With 1:45 remaining in the game, the Panthers looked to tie or take the lead. However, Mack continued his great day and stripped Newton of the ball and recovered the ball on a fourth and 10 play to ice the game for the Raiders. Mack finished with a sack, an interception, a forced fumble, and a touchdown, the first of his career. Carr finished with 315 yards and two touchdown despite missing a series with his injured finger. The Raiders improved to 9-2 on the season and remained in first place in the division. The win also clinched a winning season for the Raiders for the first time since 2002.\nQuestion: Which team had first possession?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Panthers, \n\nPassage: The first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos. The next year brought \"replacement notes\" of the 1, 5 and 10 Pesos while 1944 ushered in a 100 Peso note and soon after an inflationary 500 Pesos note. In 1945, the Japanese issued a 1,000 Pesos note. This set of new money, which was printed even before the war, became known in the Philippines as Mickey Mouse money due to its very low value caused by severe inflation. Anti-Japanese newspapers portrayed stories of going to the market laden with suitcases or \"bayong\" (native bags made of woven coconut or Corypha leaf strips) overflowing with the Japanese-issued bills. In 1944, a box of matches cost more than 100 Mickey Mouse pesos. In 1945, a kilogram of camote cost around 1000 Mickey Mouse pesos. Inflation plagued the country with the devaluation of the Japanese money, evidenced by a 60% inflation experienced in January 1944.\nQuestion: Which item cost the highest mickey mouse pesos in the 1940s, a kilogram of Camote or matches?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: As of the census of 2010, there were 181,440 people, 67,499 households, and 43,536 families residing in the county.  The population density was 158 people per square mile (61/km\u00b2). There were 77,656 housing units at an average density of 69 per square mile (27/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the county, as of 2008, was 83.2% Race (United States Census), 6.50% Race (United States Census) or Race (United States Census), 0.3% Race (United States Census), 1.7% Race (United States Census), 0.03% Race (United States Census), 2.15% from Race (United States Census), and 1.70% from two or more races.  7.6% of the population were Race (United States Census) or Race (United States Census) of any race. 19.2% were of Italian people, 16.8% Irish people, 15.5% Germans, 6.8% English people, and 4.7% United States ancestry according to Census 2000. 90.3% spoke English language, 4.5% Spanish language, 1.2% Italian language, and 1.0% German language as their first language.\nQuestion: How many percent were not German?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 84.5\n\nPassage: The Jurchens were a Tungusic-speaking group of semi-agrarian tribes inhabiting areas of northeast Asia that are now part of Northeast China. Many of the Jurchen tribes were vassals of the Liao dynasty , an empire ruled by the nomadic Khitans that included most of modern Mongolia, a portion of North China, Northeast China, northern Korea, and parts of the Russian Far East. To the south of the Liao lay the Han Chinese Song Empire . The Song and Liao were at peace, but since a military defeat to the Liao in 1005, the Song paid its northern neighbor an annual indemnity of 200,000 bolts of silk and 100,000 ounces of silver. In 1114, the chieftain Wanyan Aguda  united the disparate Jurchen tribes and led a revolt against the Liao. In 1115 he named himself emperor of the Jin \"golden\" dynasty . Informed by a Liao defector of the success of the Jurchen uprising, the Song emperor Huizong  and his highest military commander the eunuch Tong Guan saw the Liao weakness as an opportunity to recover the Sixteen Prefectures, a line of fortified cities and passes that the Liao had annexed from the Shatuo Turk Later Jin in 938, and that the Song had repeatedly but unsuccessfully tried to reconquer. The Song thus sought an alliance with the Jin against their common enemy the Liao.\nQuestion: How many years did these events span for?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 177, \n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their home loss to the Titans, the Bears flew to Lambeau Field for a Week 11 NFC North duel with their hated rival, the Green Bay Packers.  In the first quarter, Chicago trailed early as Packers QB Aaron Rodgers completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings. In the second quarter, the Bears got on the board with kicker Robbie Gould getting a 35-yard field goal.  Green Bay would answer with RB Ryan Grant getting a 4-yard TD run, along with kicker Mason Crosby getting a 53-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Chicago continued to trail as Rodgers completed a 5-yard TD pass to TE Donald Lee.  In the fourth quarter, the Packers pulled away as Crosby made a 33-yard field goal, DE Jason Hunter returned a fumble 54 yards for a touchdown, and Crosby nailing a 45-yard field goal.\nQuestion: Which player made field goals from longer than 40 yards?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Mason Crosby\n\nPassage: The first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos.

                    "Passage: During the civil war, and the ensuing Soviet\u2013Afghan War, most of the countrys infrastructure was destroyed, and normal patterns of economic activity were disrupted. The gross national product (GNP) fell substantially during Karmals rule because of the conflict; trade and transport were disrupted along with the loss of labor and capital. In 1981 the Afghan GDP stood at 154.3 billion Afghan afghanis, a drop from 159,7 billion in 1978. GNP per capita decreased from 7,370 in 1978 to 6,852 in 1981. The most dominant form of economic activity was the Agriculture in Afghanistan. Agriculture accounted for 63 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1981; 56 percent of the labour force worked in agriculture in 1982. Industry accounted for 21 percent of GDP in 1982, and employed 10 percent of the labour force. All industrial enterprises were government-owned. The service sector, the smallest of the three, accounted for 10 percent of GDP in 1981, and employed an estimated one-third of the labour force. The balance of payments, which had improved in the pre-communist administration of Muhammad Daoud Khan; the surplus decreased and became a deficit by 1982, which reached minus $US70.3 million. The only economic activity that grew substantially during Karmals rule was export and import.\nQuestion: How many percentages higher was the population that worked in agriculture in 1981 versus 1982?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 7, \n\nPassage: The Texans opened the 2006 season at home against the Philadelphia Eagles on September 10.  The Texans looked sharp early with QB David Carr throwing a 25-yard TD pass to former Bills WR Eric Moulds in the 1st Quarter.  The Eagles would tie the game with QB Donovan McNabb throwing a 42-yard TD strike to WR Donte' Stallworth. The Texans would retake the lead, however, after a 34-yard FG from K Kris Brown. Philadelphia took the lead late in the half with McNabb throwing a 5-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Brown and held on to it for the rest of the game.  In the third quarter, McNabb hooked up with RB Brian Westbrook with a 31-yard pass and then, opposing kicker David Akers ended the game in the fourth quarter with a 42-yard field goal. David Carr finished 18-of-27 for 208 yards and a touchdown and was sacked five times.\nQuestion: Which touchdown passes did Donovan McNabb make?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 42-yard, 5-yard, 31-yard\n\nPassage: In week twelve, the Bears hosted the 5-6 Tennessee Titans. The Bears were 6-5 in the all-time series, most recently a 51-20 victory in 2012, though the Bears lost the last game in Chicago, a 31-24 defeat in 2008. With Jay Cutler sidelined, Matt Barkley made his first career NFL start against a Dick LeBeau-led defense that blitzed often; on second down, the Titans recorded 12 sacks, second-most in the league. For the Bears defense, they faced an offense powered by a running game featuring DeMarco Murray and Derrick Henry, while quarterback Marcus Mariota led a unit that ranked eighth in the NFL in five-minute drives and a fifth-ranked third down conversion rate. Despite the recent woes, Jeff Joniak wrote the Bears needed to maintain a high morale and allow younger players to develop, both as players and as a team. On their opening drive, the Bears reached the Titans' 33-yard line before stalling and turning the ball over on downs. After the Titans punted, the Bears scored first when Barkley threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Daniel Brown, their first career touchdowns. The Titans responded with Henry's 11-yard touchdown run with four seconds left in the first quarter, followed by Mariota throwing a four-yard touchdown pass to Delanie Walker in the second quarter. Chicago attempted to score again when they entered Tennessee's red zone on their next drive, but Barkley's pass for Ben Braunecker was intercepted by Wesley Woodyard. The next two drives of the game ended with a punt before Mariota threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Rishard Matthews to give the Titans a 21-7 entering halftime. To start the second half, Connor Barth attempted a surprise onside kick, which bounced off Titan Nate Palmer as Adrian Amos recovered. The Bears took advantage to drive to the Titan's five-yard line, but were unable to score as Barkley's pass for Cameron Meredith was intercepted by Da'Norris Searcy in the endzone. Tennessee's Ryan Succop kicked field goals of 19 and 31 yards to increase the lead to 20 points. In the fourth quarter, Barkley began to lead a comeback as he led a 75-yard drive that ended with an eight-yard touchdown pass to Marquess Wilson, followed by a 69-yard scoring drive that concluded with a six-yard touchdown pass to Deonte Thompson to narrow the score to 27-21. The Titans were forced to punt on their next possession with 1:56 left in the game. Barkley moved the Bears downfield with 14-, 21- and 23-yard passes to Wilson, where they reached the Titans' seven-yard line to create a first-and-goal situation with 47 seconds left. Barkley's first pass to Josh Bellamy, which would have resulted in a touchdown, was dropped. His next two passes to Brown and Thompson also fell incomplete. On fourth-and-goal, Thompson dropped a Barkley pass in the back of the endzone to result in a turnover on downs. In addition to the two late drops by Bellamy and Thompson, the Bears as a whole struggled with drops, with ten total in the game and eight in the fourth quarter.\nQuestion: How many yards difference was there between Ryan Succop's longest and shortest field goals?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 12\n\nPassage: The first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos. The next year brought \"replacement notes\" of the 1, 5 and 10 Pesos while 1944 ushered in a 100 Peso note and soon after an inflationary 500 Pesos note. In 1945, the Japanese issued a 1,000 Pesos note. This set of new money, which was printed even before the war, became known in the Philippines as Mickey Mouse money due to its very low value caused by severe inflation. Anti-Japanese newspapers portrayed stories of going to the market laden with suitcases or \"bayong\" (native bags made of woven coconut or Corypha leaf strips) overflowing with the Japanese-issued bills.

QB Jake Delhomme passed for a career-high 365 yards while WR Steve Smith racked up 189 receiving yards and a touchdown, including a 72-yarder late in the fourth quarter. Also, WR Drew Carter had 4 receptions for 65 yards and a touchdown.  Ravens quarterback Kyle Boller threw two touchdowns to WR Mark Clayton that both came off tips by the Panthers secondary after Ravens starter Steve McNair left the game in the first quarter with a concussion.

From the get-go, the Niners trailed as QB Donovan McNabb managed to complete two TD passes to RB Brian Westbrook (a 4-yard pass) and WR L.J. Smith (a 1-yard pass) in the first quarter. In the second quarter, San Francisco would get on the board with Kicker Joe Nedney completing a 48-yard field goal, but Philadelphia would strike hard, as RB Brian Westbrook ran 71 yards for a touchdown and Kicker David Akers completed a 21-yard field goal. In the third quarter, both sides managed to get themselves a touchdown. Eagles DT Mike Patterson returned a 49ers fumble 98 yards for a touchdown, while the Niners' rookie RB Michael Robinson got a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, San Francisco tried to come back with Robinson getting another 1-yard TD run.  However, the Eagles got an 8-yard TD run by Westbrook.  The Niners would get one more score, as QB Alex Smith completed a TE Eric Johnson, but that would as far as they would get, as the 49ers fell to 1-2 on the year.\nQuestion: In which quarter was only one touchdown scored?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: second\n\nPassage: The AFL was growing rapidly, from 2.1 million members in 1933 to 3.4 million in 1936. But it was experiencing severe internal stresses regarding how to organize new members. Traditionally, the AFL organized unions by craft rather than industry, where electricians or stationary engineers would form their own skill-oriented unions, rather than join a large automobile-making union. Most AFL leaders, including president William Green, were reluctant to shift from the organization's longstanding craft unionism and started to clash with other leaders within the organization, such as John L. Lewis. The issue came up at the annual AFL convention in San Francisco in 1934 and 1935, but the majority voted against a shift to industrial unionism both years. After the defeat at the 1935 convention, nine leaders from the industrial faction led by Lewis met and organized the Committee for Industrial Organization within the AFL to \"encourage and promote organization of workers in the mass production industries\" for \"educational and advisory\" functions. The CIO, which later changed its name to the Congress of Industrial Organizations , formed unions with the hope of bringing them into the AFL, but the AFL refused to extend full membership privileges to CIO unions. In 1938, the AFL expelled the CIO and its million members, and they formed a rival federation. The two federations fought it out for membership; while both supported Roosevelt and the New Deal, the CIO was further to the left, while the AFL had close ties to the big city machines.\nQuestion: What event happened first, the annual convention in San Francisco, or the AFL expelling the CIO and its million members?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: AFL convention in San Francisco, 1934 and 1935,, \n\nPassage: The first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos.

                    "Passage: Hoping to build on their recent victory over the Texans, the Titans flew to Alltel Stadium for an AFC South fight with the Jacksonville Jaguars.  From the get-go, the Titans fell behind, as Jags QB David Garrard completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR Ernest Wilford and a 14-yard TD pass to TE George Wrighster in the first quarter.  In the second quarter, Jaguars kicker Josh Scobee would kick a 47-yard and a 21-yard field goal in the second quarter, giving Jacksonville a 20-0 lead over Tennessee at halftime.  In the third quarter, the Titans woes continued as Garrard hooked up with Wilford again on a 22-yard TD strike.  Then, DB Scott Starks returned an interception 55 yards for a touchdown.  Finally, Scobee would kick a 39-yard field goal, putting the game out of reach.  In the fourth quarter, Tennessee would get their only score of the game, as QB Vince Young completed a 32-yard TD pass to WR Drew Bennett.  With the loss, the Titans fell to 2-6.\nQuestion: How many times did Jacksonville score in the first half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 4, \n\nPassage: After their loss to Atlanta, Washington hosted the Minnesota Vikings, looking to snap an 8-game home losing streak. The first quarter was dominated by the Vikings, as they reached the redzone three times and intercepted Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III. However, the Redskins defense was able to stiffen in the redzone, holding the Vikings to three Blair Walsh field goals of 20, 27, and 27 yards, to give the Vikings a 9-0 advantage after one quarter. In the second, Washington finally was able to sustain a drive. The Redskins drive stalled at the Vikings' 33-yard line, however, and new Redskins kicker Kai Forbath got his first NFL opportunity, having replaced Billy Cundiff, who was cut earlier in the week, and delivered a 50-yard boot to trim the deficit to 9-3. After a Vikings three-and-out, Washington was able to run an 11-play drive that gave it its first advantage of the game, as Alfred Morris scored on a 1-yard run and gave Washington a 10-9 lead. On Minnesota's ensuing possession, Vikings quarterback Christian Ponder was sacked, fumbled, and the fumble was subsequently recovered by Lorenzo Alexander of Washington, setting the Redskins up at the Vikings 6. Robert Griffin III then found fullback Darrel Young for a 6-yard touchdown pass, extending the Redskins advantage to 17-9. In the third, Washington continued imposing its will, as they drove down the field again, this time culminating in a Robert Griffin III touchdown run, his fifth rushing touchdown of the year, setting a Washington Redskins record for rushing touchdowns by a Redskins QB and extending the Washington advantage to 24-9. The Vikings would not back down, though, and Blair Walsh connected again, this time from 37 yards, his fourth field goal on the day, to cut into the lead, and make it 24-12. In the fourth, the Vikings possessed the ball, but Ponder threw an interception straight into the waiting arms of Redskins free safety Madieu Williams, who returned it 24 yards to put the game nearly on ice, at 31-12 Washington. The Vikings, however, proved resilient. On their ensuing drive, the Vikings found the endzone for the first time on the day, with Ponder finding wide receiver Michael Jenkins for a 9-yard score. Ponder subsequently found Kyle Rudolph on a successful two-point conversion attempt, and the Redskins lead was cut to 31-20. After Washington could not extend its advantage, Minnesota got the ball back. Once again, Minnesota scored, this time Ponder found Rudolph to cut the lead to 31-26. This time, however, the two-point conversion came up short, meaning Minnesota would again need to score a touchdown to complete its rally. However, Washington's rookie QB would see to it that no comeback would be complete on his team on this day, as Griffin, on 3rd-and-6 from his own 24, found a seam on a designed quarterback draw, and raced down the sideline for a 76-yard touchdown run, the longest such rush TD by a QB since Kordell Stewart scrambled for an 80-yard score against the Carolina Panthers in the 1996 season. With the score now 38-26 Redskins, the Vikings tried to rally again, and were able to reach the Redskins' goal line. However, with less than a half minute remaining, DeAngelo Hall intercepted Christian Ponder, to officially preserve the 38-26 win. With the win, Washington improved to 3-3, snapped an 8-game home losing streak, and will have an opportunity to take first place in the NFC East with a victory over the defending Super Bowl XLVI champion New York Giants next week.\nQuestion: Who threw the first touchdown pass of the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Robert Griffin III\n\nPassage: Patriots quarterback Tom Brady threw for a career second-best 466 yards, as he completed 38 of 59 pass attempts with three touchdown throws, as the Patriots were able to hold off a late Buffalo Bills rally thanks to their high-octane offense, giving the Patriots their first divisional win of the season. The match-up between the Bills and Patriots was highly anticipated in the week before the meeting. Both teams had won their first games of the new season and high expectations for the season ahead were falling on both teams, including the host team, who were led by new head coach and old Patriots' foe Rex Ryan (formerly of the New York Jets). The Guinness Book of World Records was invited to Ralph Wilson Stadium to see if the Bills' fans could break the decibel record for crowd noise that was set at Arrowhead Stadium by Kansas City Chiefs' fans in the season prior (coincidentally in a game that the Patriots also featured in as the away team). In a heated game-day atmosphere, the Bills took the opening kickoff and drove the ball 80-yards in ten plays, with rookie running back Karlos Williams scoring on a 2-yard run. Two possessions later, the Patriots, aided by completions of 16 and 36 yards to Aaron Dobson and Gronkowski respectively, raced 62 yards in only 5 plays, with Julian Edelman catching an 8-yard touchdown pass from Brady. After another Bills three-and-out, aided by a 28-yard punt return to the Bills 27 by Danny Amendola coupled with an unnecessary roughness penalty on the Bills, the Patriots need just two plays to go 13 yards and score on a 6-yard touchdown run by Dion Lewis, taking a 14-7 lead. On the ensuing Bills' drive, Tyrod Taylor was intercepted by Super Bowl hero Malcolm Butler, who returned it 9 yards to the Bills 30. The Patriots then marched 30 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on Brady's 6-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, extending the lead to 21-7. After a Bills punt, from the Bills 48, Lewis caught a 6-yard pass, but was stripped by Paul Brown with Corey Graham returning it 29 yards to the Patriots 33, but an unnecessary roughness penalty moved them back to the 48. After being forced to punt, the Patriots drove to the Bills 48, but on 4th-and-1 Brady fired an incomplete pass. The Bills finally scored again, racing 48 yards in four penalty marred plays, scoring on a 9-yard touchdown pass to Charles Clay, trimming the deficit to 21-13, after a missed PAT. The Patriots drove to the Bills 28 on their next drive and Stephen Gostkowski converted a 46-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 24-13. The Bills advanced the ball to the 50-yard line on the next drive, but Taylor was intercepted by Harmon a deep pass intended for wide receiver Sammy Watkins with 16 seconds remaining in the half. Brady took a knee on the ensuing drive, with the Patriots going into the half leading 24-13. The Patriots drove 77 yards on the opening drive, all the way to the Bills 3-yard line, but were forced to settle for a 21-yard field goal by Gostkowski, making the score 27-13. After a Bills punt, the Patriots raced 83 yards in 9 plays, with Brady capping off the drive with a 22-yard touchdown pass to a diving Edelman, growing the lead to 34-13. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots drove to the Bills 32 and Gostkowski upping the lead to 37-13 on a 50-yard field goal. As the game entered the fourth quarter and with many Bills fans already heading for the exits, the Bills were finally able to establish rhythm with their offense, as Taylor led Buffalo on a 10-play, 80-yard drive, bombing a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Robert Woods, with a failed two-point conversion, making the score 37-19.  The Patriots drove to the Bills 41 on their next drive, but failed to convert. The Bills quickly capitalized, racing 59 yards in only 7 plays, with Taylor running in a 7-yard touchdown, with a missed two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to just 37-25. On the second play of the ensuing Patriots drive, Brady was strip-sacked by Jerry Hughes , with Preston Brown recovering for the Bills at midfield. It only took two plays to cover 50 yards, with Taylor finding Watkins for a 24-yard touchdown, making the score just 37-32 after being down 37-13. As had been the theme throughout the day, the Bills' defense was unable to keep Brady and the Patriots' offense from marching up-and-down the field, and on their final drive, New England drove to the Bills 8 and Gostkowski upped the lead to 40-32 on his 26-yard field goal. On the Bills' first play of the Bills next drive, Taylor was intercepted for the third time of the day, this time by cornerback Logan Ryan at the 50-yard line on a long pass intended for Watkins. Brady kneeled on the ensuing drive, securing the 40-32 win. The Bills' fans failed to set the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd noise.\nQuestion: How many total points were scored by Halftime?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 37\n\nPassage: The first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos. The next year brought \"replacement notes\" of the 1, 5 and 10 Pesos while 1944 ushered in a 100 Peso note and soon after an inflationary 500 Pesos note. In 1945, the Japanese issued a 1,000 Pesos note. This set of new money, which was printed even before the war, became known in the Philippines as Mickey Mouse money due to its very low value caused by severe inflation. Anti-Japanese newspapers portrayed stories of going to the market laden with suitcases or \"bayong\" (native bags made of woven coconut or Corypha leaf strips) overflowing with the Japanese-issued bills. In 1944, a box of matches cost more than 100 Mickey Mouse pesos. In 1945, a kilogram of camote cost around 1000 Mickey Mouse pesos. Inflation plagued the country with the devaluation of the Japanese money, evidenced by a 60% inflation experienced in January 1944.\nQuestion: How many years after the first issue of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos did the Japanese issue a 1,000 Pesos note?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: As of March 23, 2011, there were a total of 15,649 registered voters in Cranford Township, of which 4,887 (31.2% vs. 41.8% countywide) were registered as Democratic Party (United States), 3,701 (23.7% vs. 15.3%) were registered as Republican Party (United States) and 7,046 (45.0% vs. 42.9%) were registered as Unaffiliated (New Jersey). There were 15 voters registered to other parties. Among the townships 2010 Census population, 69.2% (vs. 53.3% in Union County) were registered to vote, including 91.2% of those ages 18 and over (vs. 70.6% countywide).\nQuestion: How many percent of residents in Cranford Township were not registered to vote?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 30.8\n\nPassage: Tampa Bay traveled west to San Francisco for the third time in five seasons. Tampa Bay lost their eighth consecutive meeting at Monster Park, dating to 1980. This game was originally scheduled for 8:15&#160;p.m. on NBC's Sunday Night Football, but on December 10, in accordance with flex-scheduling, the game was moved to the afternoon. Having already clinched a playoff berth, Tampa Bay rested most of their starters in the second half. Despite a late rally, the Buccaneers fell two points short of victory. Tampa Bay controlled most of the first half, capping off their first two drives of the first quarter with field goals by Matt Bryant. On the first play of the second quarter, Shaun Hill connected with Darrell Jackson on a 21-yard touchdown. San Francisco punted on their next drive, and Micheal Spurlock fielded the ball at the 19-yard line. He was tackled and fumbled, while the 49ers recovered. After an instant replay challenge, it was determined that Spurlock was down by contact, and Tampa Bay maintained possession. The drive fizzled though, and ended with a punt. Late in the fourth quarter, Barrett Ruud recovered a 49ers fumble, setting the Buccaneers up on the San Francisco 36-yard line. Four plays later, Jerramy Stevens caught a touchdown pass from Jeff Garcia. Tampa Bay took a 13-7 lead into halftime. On the second-half kickoff, San Francisco recovered a surprise onside kick. The drive came up empty, as they were forced to punt. On Tampa Bay's next possession, however, Luke McCown (who had taken over for the benched Garcia) fumbled and the 49ers recovered at the 14-yard line. In four plays, San Francisco scored a touchdown. Early in the fourth quarter, Nate Clements intercepted a McCown pass, and led to another 49ers touchdown. The 49ers led 21-13, but Tampa Bay still kept hopes alive for a rally. With less than six minutes left in the game, the Buccaneers drove to the 49ers 25-yard line. On 4th down and 6, McCown threw to Michael Clayton for an apparent one-handed touchdown catch, but the ball fell incomplete, and the drive turned over on downs. Tampa Bay managed one final chance to tie the score. Inside the two-minute warning, Tampa Bay drove to the 49ers 24-yard line. McCown rolled out wide to his right, and connected with Stevens for a 24-yard touchdown. McCown then attempted a game-tying two-point conversion. Michael Clayton caught the pass, but one of his feet touched out-of-bounds in the back of the endzone, sealing the game for San Francisco.\nQuestion: Whose touchdown was from more yards, Jerramy Stevens or Darrell Jackson?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Jerramy Stevens\n\nPassage: The Attempted coup of 1924 in Estonia , conducted by the Comintern, was a failed coup attempt in Estonia staged by Communists   on December 1, 1924.   Of the 279 actively participating communists, 125 were killed in action, later more than 500 people were arrested. The government forces lost 26 men. During the Soviet occupation of Estonia from 1940 until the era of Perestroika and Glasnost in the Soviet history of the Estonian SSR the communist coup attempt was referred to as Tallinn Uprising of December 1, 1924 against the Yoke of the National Bourgeoisie Government of Estonia and described as an event in the series of World revolution.\nQuestion: What month was the failed coup attempt in Estonia staged by Communists?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: December, \n\nPassage: The first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos.

                    "Passage: Looking for their first win, the 49ers flew to Arrowhead Stadium for an interconference duel with the Chiefs. In the 2nd quarter, the 49ers trailed early as QB Matt Cassel completed a 31-yard TD pass to WR Dexter McCluster. The 49ers replied with kicker Joe Nedney hitting a 51-yard field goal. The 49ers fell further behind when Chiefs' kicker Ryan Succop hit a 32-yard field goal and then in the third quarter when Cassel found WR Dwayne Bowe and TE Tony Moeaki on 45 and 18-yard TD passes, respectively. RB Thomas Jones followed these scores with a 3-yard TD run. The 49ers narrowed the score when QB Alex Smith made a 12-yard TD pass to WR Josh Morgan.\nQuestion: How many yards was the longest field goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 51\n\nPassage: According to the United Kingdom Census 2011, 84% of the population was White people (77.9% White British, 0.9% Irish migration to Great Britain, 0.1% Gypsy (term) or Irish Travellers and 5.1% Other White); 3.6% Mixed (United Kingdom ethnicity category) (1.7% white-and-black Caribbean, 0.4% white-and-black African, 0.8% white and Asian and 0.7% other mixed); 5.5% British Asian (1.6% British Pakistanis, 1.5% British Indian, 0.9% British Chinese, 0.5% British Bangladeshi, and 1% other Asian); 6% Black British (2.8% African, 1.6% British African-Caribbean people, 1.6% Other Black), 0.3% British Arabs and 0.6% with other heritage.

                    "Passage: According to the United Kingdom Census 2011, 84% of the population was White people (77.9% White British, 0.9% Irish migration to Great Britain, 0.1% Gypsy (term) or Irish Travellers and 5.1% Other White); 3.6% Mixed (United Kingdom ethnicity category) (1.7% white-and-black Caribbean, 0.4% white-and-black African, 0.8% white and Asian and 0.7% other mixed); 5.5% British Asian (1.6% British Pakistanis, 1.5% British Indian, 0.9% British Chinese, 0.5% British Bangladeshi, and 1% other Asian); 6% Black British (2.8% African, 1.6% British African-Caribbean people, 1.6% Other Black), 0.3% British Arabs and 0.6% with other heritage. Bristol is unusual among major British towns and cities in its larger black than Asian population. These statistics apply to the Bristol Unitary Authority area, excluding areas of the urban area (2006 estimated population 587,400) in South Gloucestershire, Bath and North East Somerset (BANES) and North Somerset\u2014such as Kingswood, Mangotsfield, Filton and Warmley. 56.2% of the 209,995 Bristol residents who are employed commute to work using either a car, van, motorbike or taxi, 2.2% commute by rail and 9.8% by bus, while 19.6% walk.\nQuestion: How many percent of people were not British Arabs?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 99.7, \n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Packers, the Vikings' Week 11 opponent was the Oakland Raiders, who had former Vikings quarterback Daunte Culpepper under center. After a 79-yard pass from wide receiver Sidney Rice to Visanthe Shiancoe on the first play from scrimmage, the Vikings scored on the very next play on a 10-yard run from Chester Taylor. This was followed by a safety when Culpepper was penalized for intentional grounding in his own endzone. Two plays after the ensuing free kick, the Vikings fumbled the ball just inside Oakland territory, allowing the Raiders to set up a 42-yard field goal for Sebastian Janikowski. On the next drive, the Vikings restored their nine-point lead as kicker Ryan Longwell hit a 30-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter. A short Oakland drive culminating in 10-yard touchdown pass from Culpepper to tight end John Madsen, followed by another Janikowski field goal, saw the Raiders take the lead for the first time. Four plays later, Minnesota regained a six-point lead on a 38-yard touchdown run from Taylor, but field goals of 42 and 49 yards from Janikowski meant the first half ended with the scores level at 19-19. The Vikings recorded the only score of the third quarter on a 38-yard field goal from Longwell, though they did finish the period on the Raiders' 6-yard line, allowing Taylor to run in his third touchdown on the opening play of the fourth quarter, the first time in his career that he scored three touchdowns in one game. A 52-yard field goal from Janikowski narrowed the margin to 7 points with less than three-and-a-half minutes to play, and after forcing the Vikings to punt just inside the two-minute warning, they had one last chance to level the scores. On the first play of the drive, Culpepper threw the ball in the direction of Justin Fargas, who tipped it up, allowing Chad Greenway to come up with an interception; he went to ground with the ball, but inexplicably got up and attempted to advance it, which allowed left tackle Barry Sims to force a fumble, recovered by right guard Paul McQuistan. That enabled the Raiders to extend their drive, but although they managed to get into Vikings territory, a false start penalty meant Culpepper had to attempt a Hail Mary pass on the final play, but it came up short, giving the Vikings a 29-22 win.\nQuestion: Which player scored the first touchdown?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Chester Taylor\n\nPassage: T. J. Yates started his second game of the season for the Texans due to Brian Hoyer being out with a concussion. Both teams were held scoreless in the 1st quarter, with the Colts striking first with Matt Hasselbeck connecting with Donte Moncrief for an 11-yard touchdown reception. With Adam Vinatieri making the extra point, Indianapolis lead 7-0 late in the 2nd quarter. The Colts scored again with Vinatieri making a 29-yard field goal, extending their lead to 10-0. The Texans managed to get on the board as the half wined down with a 22-yard field goal from Nick Novak. With Novak's field goal, Houston trailed 3-10 at the half. The Texans' defense held the Colts' offense to zero points in the 2nd half, while Houston's offense scored 13 unanswered points. The Texans made history by beating the Colts in Indianapolis for the first time in franchise history, winning 16-10. Third string quarterback Brandon Weeden helped the Texans past the Colts with an 8-yard pass to Jaelen Strong late in the 4th quarter. With the win, the Texans went to 7-7 and gained sole possession of the AFC South lead. Yates suffered an ACL tear during the game, ending his season.\nQuestion: How long was the first touchdown reception?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 11-yard, \n\nPassage: The first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos.

In the first quarter, Indianapolis took the lead as kicker Adam Vinatieri got a 23-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Chargers took the lead as kicker Nate Kaeding made a 35-yard field goal, while QB Philip Rivers completed a 39-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson.  The Colts would tie the game as QB Peyton Manning completed a 13-yard TD pass to WR Anthony Gonzalez. In the third quarter, Indianapolis took the lead as Manning completed a 1-yard TD pass to RB Dominic Rhodes.  In the fourth quarter, the Colts added onto their lead as Vinatieri got a 38-yard field goal.  San Diego cut the Colts' lead to 3 as Rivers completed a 1-yard TD pass to FB Jacob Hester, and then Kaeding kicked a 47-yard field goal to tie the game.  However, Indianapolis sealed the deal as Vinatieri nailed the game-winning 51-yard field goal. By making the kick, Vinatieri redeemed himself after missing a game-winning 29-yard field goal against San Diego in the previous season.\nQuestion: Who threw the longest touchdown pass of the first half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Philip Rivers, \n\nPassage: The effectiveness of heat-seeking missiles was only 7% early in the Vietnam War, but improved to approximately 15%\u201340% over the course of the war. The AIM-4 Falcon used by the USAF had kill rates of approximately 7% and was considered a failure. The AIM-9B Sidewinder introduced later achieved 15% kill rates, and the further improved AIM-9D and J models reached 19%. The AIM-9G used in the last year of the Vietnam air war achieved 40%. Israel used almost totally guns in the 1967 Six-Day War, achieving 60 kills and 10 losses. However, Israel made much more use of steadily improving heat-seeking missiles in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. In this extensive conflict Israel scored 171 of out of 261 total kills with heat-seeking missiles (65.5%), 5 kills with radar guided missiles (1.9%), and 85 kills with guns (32.6%). The AIM-9L Sidewinder scored 19 kills out of 26 fired missiles (73%) in the 1982 Falklands War. But, in a conflict against opponents using thermal countermeasures, the United States only scored 11 kills out of 48 fired (Pk  23%) with the follow-on AIM-9M in the Gulf War.\nQuestion: How many of Israel's 261 total kills were not done by heat-seeking missiles?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 90\n\nPassage: The first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos.

                    "Passage: After a tough road loss to the Patriots, the Steelers traveled home to take on the Bills.  The Bills scored first in the first quarter when Dan Carpenter nailed a 20-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead and the only score of the quarter.  The Steelers however, responded by doing it big starting off in the 2nd quarter tying the game at 3 when Shaun Suisham nailed a 36-yard field goal.  They would increase their lead as Ben Roethlisberger found Jerricho Cotchery on a 5-yard TD pass giving them a 10-3 halftime lead.  After the break, the Steelers went back to work as Le'Von Bell ran for a 4-yard TD increasing their lead to 17-3.  They followed up in the 4th quarter with 2 Suisham field goals from 37 and 23 yards out for a lead of 20-3 and then 23-3 respectively.  The Bills finally managed to score a TD in the final seconds of the game when EJ Manuel found Chris Gragg on a 2-yard pass, making the final score 23-10 sealing the win for the Steelers improving themselves to 3-6.\nQuestion: How many total field goal yards did  Shaun Suisham make?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 96\n\nPassage: Armenians have had a continuous documented presence in Cyprus since 578 AD: according to historian Theophylact Simocatta, during his campaign against the Persian King Chosroes I, Byzantine General Maurice the Cappadocian captured 10,090 Armenians as prisoners in Arzanene, of whom about 3,350 were deported to Cyprus. More Armenians arrived during the reign of Armenian-descended Emperor Heraclius for political reasons and also during the pontificate of Catholicos Hovhannes III Odznetsi for commercial reasons. Flowing on, after the end of Arab raids in Cyprus, more arrived by the patrician Niketas Chalkoutzes for military reasons, when Armenian mercenaries were transferred to Cyprus to protect it. In the middle Byzantine period, Armenian generals and governors served in Cyprus, like Alexios Mousele or Mousere who undertook the construction of Saint Lazarus' basilica in Larnaca. It appears that Saint Lazarus' church had been an Armenian Apostolic church in the 10th century and was used by Armenian-Catholics during the Latin Era as well. The numerous Armenians required an analogous spiritual pastorate, and so in 973 Catholicos Khatchig I established the Armenian Bishopric in Nicosia. Relations between Cyprus and the Armenians became closer when the Kingdom of Cilicia was established. Between 1136-1138, Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus moved the entire population of the Armenian city of Tell Hamdun to Cyprus. After Isaac Comnenus' wedding to the daughter of the Armenian prince Thoros II in 1185, Armenian nobles and warriors came with him to Cyprus, many of whom defended the island against Richard the Lionheart, when he landed in Limassol.\nQuestion: How many of the Armenians captured were not deported to Cyprus?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 6740\n\nPassage: As of the census of 2010, there were 2,213 people, 870 households, and 563 families residing in the town.

                    "Passage: Hoping to recover from their first loss of the season at Indianapolis, the Broncos returned home for an interconference match against the Washington Redskins. A 6-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Wes Welker gave the Broncos the early lead. The Redskins tied the game just before halftime, with quarterback Robert Griffin III connecting on a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Leonard Hankerson. Early in the third quarter, the Redskins grabbed a 21-7 lead, with two touchdowns in only 19 seconds &#8212; both off Manning turnovers. Following a Manning fumble, Redskins' running back Alfred Morris rushed for a 1-yard touchdown. On the first play of the Broncos' next possession, Manning was intercepted by cornerback DeAngelo Hall, who returned the football 26 yards for a touchdown. However, the Broncos would score the final 38 points of the game. Midway through the third quarter, running back Montee Ball rushed for a 4-yard touchdown. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, Manning connected on a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Joel Dreessen to tie the game at 21-21. The Redskins' offense went three-and-out on their next possession, and after punter Sav Rocca shanked a punt to the Redskins' 35-yard line, the Broncos immediately grabbed the lead on the first play of their next possession, with Manning throwing a 35-yard touchdown pass to running back Knowshon Moreno on a screen play. On the Redskins' next possession, Broncos' linebacker Von Miller forced a fumble off RGIII deep in Redskins' territory, though the Broncos had to settle on a 19-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. Midway through the fourth quarter, Manning threw his fourth touchdown pass of the game &#8212; a 35-yarder to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. The final scoring play of the game came courtesy of cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie returning an interception off Redskins' quarterback Kirk Cousins 75 yards for a touchdown. This was Redskins' head coach Mike Shanahan's first visit to Denver since being fired by the Broncos after the 2008 season. Shanahan, who coached the Broncos from 1995-2008, is the winningest head coach in Broncos' franchise history, with 146 wins.\nQuestion: Who caught the longest touchdown of the first half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Leonard Hankerson\n\nPassage: At the Corfu European Council, held on 24-25 June 1994, the EU officially confirmed that Cyprus would be included in the Union's next phase of enlargement. Two weeks later, on 5 July, the European Court of Justice imposed restrictions on the export of goods from Northern Cyprus into the European Union. Soon afterwards, in December, relations between the EU and Turkey were further damaged when Greece blocked the final implementation of a customs union. As a result, talks remained completely blocked throughout 1995 and 1996. In December 1996, the European Court of Human Rights  delivered a landmark ruling that declared that Turkey was an occupying power in Cyprus. The case - Loizidou v. Turkey - centred on Titina Loizidou, a refugee from Kyrenia, who was judged to have been unlawfully denied the control of her property by Turkey. The case also had severe financial implications as the Court later ruled that Turkey should pay Mrs Loizidou US$825,000 in compensation for the loss of use of her property. Ankara rejected the ruling as politically motivated. After twenty years of talks, a settlement seemed as far off as ever. However, the basic parameters of a settlement were by now internationally agreed. Cyprus would be a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation. A solution would also be expected to address the following issues:\nQuestion: How many days did the Corfu European Council last?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2, \n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their divisional home loss to the Steelers, the Bengals flew to Ralph Wilson Stadium for a Week 9 intraconference duel with the Buffalo Bills.  In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Bills QB J. P. Losman completed an 8-yard TD pass to WR Lee Evans.  Fortunately, the Bengals answered with QB Carson Palmer completing a 15-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh.  In the second quarter, Buffalo retook the lead with kicker Rian Lindell getting a 23-yard field goal.  Immediately afterwards, Cincinnati would take the lead as WR/KR Glenn Holt returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown.  The Bills ended the half with Lindell getting a 21-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Buffalo regained the lead with Lindell kicking a 29-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Bengals went back into the lead with Palmer completing a 1-yard TD pass to FB Jeremi Johnson.  Unfortunately, Cincinnati's struggles continued with Lindell nailing a 38-yard field goal, along with RB Marshawn Lynch completing an 8-yard TD pass to TE Robert Royal & getting a 56-yard TD run.\nQuestion: Who threw most number of TD passes?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Carson Palmer\n\nPassage: The first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos.

The tie did not last long as kicker Dave Rayner hit a 50-yard field goal. They took the lead with RB Matt Forte getting a 14-yard TD run. They fell behind again after Stanton completed a 46-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson, followed by Rayner nailing a 25-yard field goal. The Bears responded to take the win with kicker Robbie Gould making a 54-yard field goal, followed by QB Jay Cutler making a 7-yard TD pass to TE Brandon Manumaleuna.\nQuestion: How many yards was the shortest touchdown run?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1\n\nPassage: The Rams' sixth game was an Interconference duel against the San Diego Chargers inside their dome.

With the win, the Rams improved to 3-3 snapping their 13-game losing streak against AFC Opponents.\nQuestion: Which kicker kicked the least amount of field goals?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Nate Kaeding\n\nPassage: Coming off their bye week, the Giants went home, donned their alternate uniforms, and played  the Dallas Cowboys.  In the first quarter, New York trailed early as Cowboys QB Tony Romo completed a 15-yard TD pass to TE Tony Curtis.  The Giants responded as QB Eli Manning completed an 8-yard TD pass to TE Jeremy Shockey.  In the second quarter, Dallas regained the lead as kicker Nick Folk made a 44-yard field goal. The G-Men took the lead with RB Reuben Droughns getting a 1-yard TD run.  Afterwards, the Cowboys retook the lead with Romo completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.  Originally, the Giants were willing to be down by 3 at halftime.  However, because of a taunting penalty on Dallas LB Kevin Burnett placed them near midfield, New York went for some points.  The Giants would tie the game with kicker Lawrence Tynes getting a 40-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Romo completed a 25-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens and the Cowboys regained the lead.  In the fourth quarter, the Giants made a 26-yard field goal from Tynes.  Afterwards, Dallas' Romo and Owens hooked up with each other again on a 50-yard TD pass. During the season series against the Cowboys, the Giants pass defense allowed 8 passing touchdowns, despite only allowing 8 passing touchdowns from their previous opponents this year.\nQuestion: How many passing yards off of touchdowns did Tony Romo have in the first half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 35\n\nPassage: The first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos. The next year brought \"replacement notes\" of the 1, 5 and 10 Pesos while 1944 ushered in a 100 Peso note and soon after an inflationary 500 Pesos note. In 1945, the Japanese issued a 1,000 Pesos note. This set of new money, which was printed even before the war, became known in the Philippines as Mickey Mouse money due to its very low value caused by severe inflation. Anti-Japanese newspapers portrayed stories of going to the market laden with suitcases or \"bayong\" (native bags made of woven coconut or Corypha leaf strips) overflowing with the Japanese-issued bills. In 1944, a box of matches cost more than 100 Mickey Mouse pesos. In 1945, a kilogram of camote cost around 1000 Mickey Mouse pesos. Inflation plagued the country with the devaluation of the Japanese money, evidenced by a 60% inflation experienced in January 1944.\nQuestion: What was more expensive, matches in 1944 or a kilogram of camote in 1945?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: Upon his appointment as Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw in 1198, Jaros\u0142aw of Opole, elder son of the Silesian duke Boles\u0142aw I the Tall, received the territories around the town of Nysa  from his father. After Jaros\u0142aw's death in 1201, his half-brother Duke Henry I the Bearded of Silesia decided to leave Nysa, as well as the castellany of Otmuch\u00f3w, under the control of the Diocese of Wroc\u0142aw, while the rest of the late Jaros\u0142aw's Upper Silesian lands were annexed by his uncle Mieszko IV Tanglefoot in the following year. In 1290 Henry IV Probus, duke of Lower Silesia at Wroc\u0142aw, gave the bishops privileges of autonomy on their lands in Nysa, creating the legal basis for the Duchy of Nysa. Henry of Wierzbna, Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw from 1302 to 1319, was the first to actually use the title of a Duke of Nysa. The duchy in its original form only lasted until 1335, when Silesia passed to the Kingdom of Bohemia by the Treaty of Trentschin. In 1342 Bishop Przec\u0142aw of Pogorzeli swore the oath of fealty to King John the Blind and afterwards played a vital role in the negotiations for the 1348 Treaty of Namslau between John's successor Charles IV and King Casimir III the Great of Poland. Pogorzeli also significantly enlarged his territory by acquisition of Grodk\u00f3w  from Duke Boles\u0142aw III the Generous of Brzeg in 1344. For the next two hundred years, the Polish, Czech and German inhabitants of Nysa-Grodk\u00f3w lived in relative harmony, even during the beginnings of the Reformation as the control of the region switched between Protestant and Catholic rulers. This ended with the Thirty Years' War.\nQuestion: How many years was Jaros\u0142aw of Opole Bishop of Wroclaw 1198-1201?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3, \n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their home loss to the Colts, the Panthers flew to LP Field for a Week 9 interconference duel with the Tennessee Titans. In the first quarter, Carolina trailed early as Titans QB Vince Young got a 3-yard TD run, while kicker Rob Bironas got a 47-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Panthers continued to struggle as Bironas nailed a 53-yard field goal for the only score of the period. After a scoreless third quarter, Tennessee pulled away with RB LenDale White getting a 1-yard TD run. Carolina would avoid a shutout as QB David Carr completed an 18-yard TD pass to WR Drew Carter. Carr would relive his Texans days as he got sacked 7 times during the game.\nQuestion: How many yards longer was the second field goal than the first field goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 6\n\nPassage: Colt McCoy returned for the Cleveland Browns' week 15 Battle of Ohio against the Cincinnati Bengals. The Browns scored on their opening drive on a 20-yard pass from McCoy to Robert Royal. The Bengals answered with Cedric Benson's 18-yard run to tie the game. Over the rest of the second and third quarters, Clint Stitser hit three field goals to give the Bengals a 16-7 lead. After trading field goals in the fourth, the Browns got within two on a 46-yard pass to Brian Robiskie. However, the Browns failed to stop a third down conversion on the Bengals' next possession, and the Browns lost 19-17. With the loss, the Browns fell to 5-9 and finished the season 2-6 on the road.\nQuestion: How many touchdowns did the Bengals score in the first half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1\n\nPassage:  Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.

                    "Passage: Barnard Castle has road connections to Bishop Auckland, Spennymoor and central County Durham via the A688 and Darlington, Stockton-on-Tees, and Middlesbrough by the A67. Barnard Castle is also four miles  from the A66, with access to the M6 to the west and the A1 to the east. The B6278 also connects Barnard Castle with Middleton-in-Teesdale. Barnard Castle railway station was closed for passenger trains in 1964. A Bill was approved in 1854 for a line from a junction with the Stockton & Darlington Railway at Darlington to Barnard Castle and opened on 9 July 1856, with intermediate stations at Broomielaw, Winston, Gainford & Piercebridge. The terminus at Darlington only lasted five years.  In 1856 the South Durham & Lancashire Railway proposed a line from Bishop Auckland to Tebay via Barnard Castle and Kirkby Stephen but only the western section was built with the Company receiving its Bill in 1857.  The line opened on 8 August 1861 from a second terminus at Barnard Castle to a junction with the Lancaster & Carlisle Railway at Tebay with intermediate stations at Lartington, Bowes, Barras, Kirkby Stephen, Ravenstondale & Gaisgill. The two stations at Barnard Castle were some distance apart; the earliest station became a through station and closed to passengers on 1 May 1862, but remained in use as a goods depot. The second station was closed for passenger trains under the Beeching cuts in 1964 and completely on 5 April 1965 and the site was eventually built on by Glaxo Smith Kline. Today rail access is via Bishop Auckland, 15\u00a0miles  or Darlington, 16\u00a0miles .\nQuestion: How many sections of the line from Bishop Auckland to Tebay were built?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1, \n\nPassage: Anaukpetlun would not spend his scarce resources on subjugating Siam. His strategy was to pick off Siam's peripheral regions rather than launch a full-scale invasion. On 30 November 1613, he sent a small army of 4,000  to drive out the Siamese from upper Tenasserim coast. On 26 December 1613, the army defeated the Siamese at Tavoy. The Burmese followed down to Tenasserim port itself. But the Burmese were driven back with heavy losses by the wealthy port's Portuguese broadsides in March 1614. The Siamese tried to retake Tavoy but failed. Anaukpetlun then switched theatres to Lan Na, which like Martaban before was only a nominal vassal of Siam. His armies of 17,000 invaded Lan Na on 30 April 1614 from Martaban in the south and Mone in the north. Lan Na's ruler, Thado Kyaw, desperately sought help. Help came from Lan Xang, not his overlord Siam. Despite the logistical troubles and the rainy season conditions, the Burmese armies finally achieved encirclement of Lan Na and Lan Xang forces in the Chiang Mai and Lanphun pocket in August 1614. After nearly five months, on 22 December 1614, the city surrendered. Siam would not make any attempts to recover Lan Na until 1663.\nQuestion: How many more soldiers did Anaukpetlun use at Lan Na than at the Tenasserim coast?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 13000, \n\nPassage: Coming off The Redskins' home win over the Cardinals, they traveled to Gillette Stadium for a Week 8 inter-conference duel with the undefeated New England Patriots. In the first quarter, Washington trailed early as New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady got a 3-yard touchdown run for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Redskins continued to fall behind as Brady completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to linebacker Mike Vrabel, kicker Stephen Gostkowski nailed a 36-yard field goal, and Brady pulled a \"Marino\"&#8212;by doing a fake spike and then completing a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Randy Moss. In the third quarter, Washington's deficit increased when Brady got a 2-yard touchdown run, along with linebacker Rosevelt Colvin returning a fumble 11 yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, the Patriots finished their job with Brady completing a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Wes Welker, along with back-up quarterback Matt Cassel getting a 15-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, the Redskins got their only score of the game when quarterback Jason Campbell completed a 15-yard touchdown pass to tight end Chris Cooley. With the loss, not only did the Redskins fall to 4-3, but the Redskins allowed the most points in a single game since 1961 (53 points to the New York Giants).\nQuestion: What team won the game before this?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: The Redskins, \n\nPassage:  Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.  They would wear their alternate uniforms as they played against the New England Patriots.  In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski got a 31-yard field goal, while QB Tom Brady completed a 1-yard TD pass to LB Mike Vrabel.  In the second quarter, the Bengals managed to get on the board with QB Carson Palmer completing a 1-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh.  However, New England would respond with Brady completing a 7-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss. Near the end of the 2nd quarter, the Bengals had a chance to get closer to the Pats, but a miscommunication between Palmer and Chad Johnson resulted in a New England interception. Palmer and Johnson argued on the sidelines and all the way back to the locker room. In the third quarter, Cincinnati continued to struggle as Patriots RB Sammy Morris getting a 7-yard TD run.  The Bengals' only response would be kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 40-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, New England increased its lead with Gostkowski kicking a 36-yard field goal.  Cincinnati's final response was Graham kicking a 48-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Patriots sealed the win with Brady and Moss hooking up with each other again on a 14-yard TD pass. With their third-straight loss, the Bengals entered their bye week at 1-3.  It also marked Cincinnati's 5th loss to New England in the last 6 meetings. After the game, Marvin Lewis was heard yelling at his players for their 1-3 record. He called a team meeting a few days later and said that \"anyone who doesn't want to play shouldn't show up\".\nQuestion: Who kicked the longest field goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

The population density was 4,093.9 people per square mile (1,580.7/km\u00b2), making it less densely populated than Detroit proper and its inner-ring suburbs like Oak Park, Michigan and Ferndale, Michigan, but more densely populated than outer-ring suburbs like Livonia, Michigan and Troy, Michigan. The racial makeup of the city was 73.0% White (U.S. Census) (70.4% non-Hispanic White), 7.7% Race and ethnicity in the United States Census, 0.3% Race and ethnicity in the United States Census, 14.4% Race and ethnicity in the United States Census, 0.0%  Race and ethnicity in the United States Census, 1.0% from Race and ethnicity in the United States Census, and 3.6% from two or more races.

In this battle, King Olaf II of Norway  was killed. During the pontificate of Pope Alexander III, the Roman Catholic Church  declared Olaf a saint in 1164. His younger half-brother, Harald Hardrada, was also present at the battle. Harald was only fifteen when the battle of Stiklestad took place. He became King of Norway in 1047, only to die in a failed invasion of England at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066. The authenticity of the battle as a historical event is subject to question. Contemporary sources say the king was murdered. According to the Anglo Saxon Chronicle of 1030, Olaf was killed by his own people. Adam of Bremen wrote in 1070 that Olaf was killed in an ambush, and so did Florence of Worcester in 1100. Those are the only contemporary sources that mention the death of the king. After the king's canonization it was felt that the saint could not have died in such circumstances.  The story of the Battle of Stiklestad as we know it gradually developed during the two centuries following the death of King Olaf. Saint Olaf must have fallen in a major battle for Christianity.\nQuestion: What year did King Olaf II die?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1030, \n\nPassage:  Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.

Just 1:18 into the game Randall Cobb managed to make a punt-return TD over 80 yards to give the Packers the lead. The Vikings managed just 1 first down before the Packers defense forced them into another punt, Aaron Rodgers & co. took advantage of it and the lead went up to 14. 1:18 before the end of the first quarter the Vikings kicker Ryan Longwell missed a 52-yd field goal. The second quarter started the way the first went with a Packers score, Mason Crosby connected on a 25-yd FG. No more scoring happened in this half, Tramon Williams successfully intercepted a pass by Ponder, making it only the second highlight that quarter. The Vikings were shut down by the Packers defense by managing not to score the whole first half. At the start of the third quarter Rodgers found Jordy Nelson for a 17-yd TD pass to push the lead to 24-0. Later on, Adrian Peterson scored a TD after a 3-yd run to give Minnesota the only points in the game. The rest of the way was a one-sided affair, with the Packers scoring another three touchdowns. John Kuhn and Nelson for the second time gave Rodgers two more TD passes in this game. Rodgers watched the last 10:30 of the game from the bench, looking at his backup Matt Flynn, who did score a 3-yd run TD 4:33 before the end of the game. With this win the Packers went to 9-0 sweeping the Vikings in the season and dropping the Vikings to 2-7. Rodgers again had a good passing game with connecting on 23 of his 30 pass attempts. Nelson was next to Rodgers the player of the game with his two touchdowns.

The Vikings would answer in the second quarter with a 2-yard touchdown run from running back Adrian Peterson, yet the Steelers struck back with Ben Roethlisberger completing a 40-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Mike Wallace. Both teams would swap field goals in the third quarter, with Reed booting a 27-yard field goal and Vikings kicker Ryan Longwell making an 18-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh defense came up with a huge play as defensive end Brett Keisel forced a fumble off of Vikings quarterback Brett Favre, allowing linebacker LaMarr Woodley to return the fumble 77&#160;yards for a touchdown.  However, Minnesota immediately struck back as wide receiver Percy Harvin returned a kickoff 88&#160;yards for a touchdown.

The Ottoman Empire suffered defeat at the Battle of Vienna in 1683 and was forced to withdraw rapidly from Central Europe. The defeat and the chaotic situation within the Ottoman Empire created widespread social disruption in the Central Balkans, particularly in the regions of Skopje and Ni\u0161, where Karposh's rebellion originated. On 25 October 1689, the Austrian branch of the Holy League, led by General Piccolomini, reached the Plain of Skopje and were met with rejoicing by the inhabitants of the villages there. The same day, Piccolomini began a withdrawal of his forces, and on October 26, set fire to the city. Skopje burned for two whole days, through the 26th and 27 October. Most of the city of Skopje was destroyed in the fire. Some accounts of these events state that Piccolomini razed Skopje due to an inability of his forces to occupy and govern a city so far from his headquarters, while other accounts state that it was perpetrated to prevent the spread of infectious disease.\nQuestion: What happened first: the Battle of Vienna or Piccolomini reached the Plain of Skopje?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: the Battle of Vienna, \n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Panthers, the 49ers went home for a Week 14 duel with the Minnesota Vikings. In the first quarter, the Niners trailed early as Vikings DT Kevin Williams returned an interception 18 yards for a touchdown, while kicker Ryan Longwell managed to get a 48-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Minnesota sealed the win early as QB Tarvaris Jackson completed a 19-yard TD pass to WR Robert Ferguson, Longwell nailing a 46-yard field goal, and RB Chester Taylor getting an 84-yard TD run. In the third quarter, San Francisco would get their only score of the game as QB Shaun Hill completed a 5-yard TD pass to WR Arnaz Battle. With the loss, the 49ers fell to 3-10. The only positive from the game was that the Niners held rookie RB phenom Adrian Peterson to just 3 rushing yards on 14 carries. Starting QB Trent Dilfer (7/19 for 45 yards and 1 interception) left the game in the second quarter with a head injury.\nQuestion: How many yards per carry did Adrian Peterson average during this game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 0.21\n\nPassage:  Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.

                    "Passage: As of the census of 2000, there were 197,790 people, 84,549 households, and 43,627 families residing in the city. The population density was 3,292.6 people per square mile (1,271.3/km\u00b2). There were 92,282 housing units at an average density of 1,536.2 per square mile (593.1/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the city was 57.2% African American (U.S. Census), 38.3% White (U.S. Census), 0.2% Native American (U.S. Census), 1.3% Asian (U.S. Census), 0.1% Pacific Islander (U.S. Census), 1.5% from Race (United States Census), and 1.5% from two or more races. Hispanic (U.S. Census) or Latino (U.S. Census) of any race were 2.6% of the population.\nQuestion: How many people, in terms of percentage of the population, are not either solely White or solely African American?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 4.5\n\nPassage: The winner of this Sunday Night showdown would assume first place in the NFC East (the Eagles outright, the Giants on tiebreakers). With two games against opponents with losing records approaching, it was crucial for the Giants to escape this one with a win. The Eagles started things off right away, putting 14 points on the board before the Giants had run their fifth play from scrimmage. McNabb connected with Celek for a touchdown, and Sheldon Brown returned a Brandon Jacobs fumble for six points on the ensuing drive. In the second quarter, Nicks caught the longest reception of his short career for a 68-yard touchdown. After DeSean Jackson responded by returning a Jeff Feagles punt 72 yards for a touchdown, the Giants were able to send Bradshaw into the end zone from the 3. Eagles backup quarterback Michael Vick was able to sneak in one more rushing touchdown before halftime. Jacobs opened the scoring in the second half with a 1-yard rush. After the teams traded turnovers, Manning got the ball into Hixon's hands for a 61-yard touchdown. But the Eagles responded on the very next play with a 60-yard touchdown to Jackson. Jackson's 176 receiving yards amounted to the best individual receiving performance against the Giants since 2002. The Eagles struck again in the fourth quarter, this time on a run by fullback Leonard Weaver and a two-point conversion pass to Jason Avant. The Giants put another touchdown on the board (courtesy of Boss) in the last two minutes of the game, and got the ball back with 28 seconds left. But defensive end Darren Howard sacked Manning and forced a fumble, sealing the Eagles' first sweep of the Giants since 2004. The Giants had given up 85 points to the Eagles this year, the most they had ever given up to the Eagles in a single season in franchise history, including four playoff years where they met the Eagles a third time. The Giants' 38 points were also the most scored by a losing team since Week 2 of 2008.\nQuestion: Who scored the longest touchdown?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: DeSean Jackson\n\nPassage: The 2011 census showed that there are fewer young people in Aberdeen, with 16.4% under 16, opposed to the national average of 19.2%. According to the 2011 census Aberdeen is 91.9% white, ethnically, 24.7% were born outside Scotland, higher than the national average of 16%. Of this population 7.6% were born in other parts of the UK. 8.2% of Aberdonians stated to be from an ethnic minority (non-white) in the 2011 census, with 9,519 (4.3%) being Asian, with 3,385 (1.5%) coming from India and 2,187 (1.0%) being British Chinese. The city has around 5,610 (2.6%) residents of African or Caribbean origin, which is a higher percentage than both Glasgow and Edinburgh. The most multicultural part of the city is George Street, which has many ethnic restaurants, supermarkets and hairdressers.  In the household, there were 97,013 individual dwellings recorded in the city of which 61% were privately owned, 9% privately rented and 23% rented from the council. The most popular type of dwellings are apartments which comprise 49% of residences followed by semi-detached at just below 22%. The median income of a household in the city is \u00a316,813 (the mean income is \u00a320,292) (2005) which places approximately 18% households in the city below the poverty line (defined as 60% of the mean income). Conversely, an Aberdeen postcode has the second highest number of millionaires of any postcode in the UK.\nQuestion: How many percent of people were not white?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 8.1\n\nPassage:  Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.

In the first quarter the Chiefs trailed early as kicker Adam Vinatieri made a 20-yard field goal, followed by a 24-yard field goal in the second quarter. The Chiefs replied with kicker Ryan Succop nailing a 45-yard field goal. In the third quarter the Colts increased their lead with Vinatieri's 47-yard field goal, followed by Succop's 35 and 43-yard field goals to tie the game. In the fourth quarter the Chiefs trailed slightly with Vinatieri getting a 42-yard field goal. After that, the Chiefs defense was finally broken down with RB Mike Hart getting an 11-yard TD run. With the loss, the Chiefs fell to 3-1 and it also marked the first time since 1970 where no teams start out 4-0.\nQuestion: Which player scored at least 1 field goal in the second half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Vinatieri\n\nPassage: For week 14, the Bears traveled to St. Louis, Missouri to play the St. Louis Rams. Prior to the game, a quarterback controversy arose between Rex Grossman and Brian Griese regarding the Bears' starting quarterback position. Grossman, who finished the preceding game with a quarterback rating of 1.3, was eager to make a statement, and rebound against the same team which injured him during the previous year's preseason. Grossman rose to the occasion, and spearheaded the Bears to a 42-27 victory over the Rams, while rookie CB Devin Hester had a record-breaking performance. Also, many spectators of the Monday night game may remember Senator Barack Obama's humorous television introduction before kickoff. During the course of the game, Hester broke the NFL record for combined return touchdowns in a single season with six. He also became the sixth player in NFL history to return two kicks for touchdowns in a single game. For his performance, he earned the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week Award. On a low note, kicker Robbie Gould uncharacteristically missed two field goal attempts, and the Bears announced that defensive tackle Tommie Harris would miss the remainder of the season with a severe hamstring injury.\nQuestion: Which QB did not start for the Bears?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Brian Griese, \n\nPassage: In 1905, the Qing sent Zhao Erfeng to Tibet to retaliate against rebellions. By 1908, Zhao was appointed imperial resident in Lhasa. Zhao was beheaded in December 1911 by pro-Republican forces. The bulk of the area that was historically known as Kham was now claimed to be the Xikang Administrative District, created by the Republican revolutionaries. By the end of 1912, the last Manchu troops were forced out of Tibet through India. Thubten Gyatso, the 13th Dalai Lama, returned to Tibet in January 1913 from Sikkim, where he had been residing. When the new ROC government apologised for the actions of the Qing and offered to restore the Dalai Lama to his former position, he replied that he was not interested in Chinese ranks, that Tibet had never been subordinated to China, that Tibet was an independent country, and that he was assuming the spiritual and political leadership of Tibet. Because of this, many have read this reply as a formal declaration of independence. The Chinese side ignored the response, and Tibet had thirty years free of interference from China.\nQuestion: How many years after Zhao was beheded did the 13th Dalai Lama return to Tibet from Sikkim?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2, \n\nPassage:  Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.

                    "Passage: On 23 June 1596, an Ottoman Army marched from the city of Istanbul. Commanded by Sultan Mehmed III, the army marched through Edirne, Filibe , Sofia and Ni\u0161 to arrive at Belgrade on 9 August. On 20 August, the army crossed the River Sava by bridge and entered the Austrian territory of Siren. A war council was called at Slankamen Castle, and it was decided that they would begin a siege on the Hungarian fort of Eger . The fort controlled the communication routes between Habsburg Austria and Transylvania, all of whom were in revolt against the Ottoman suzerainty. However, news soon arrived that the Austrians had besieged and succeeded in taking over the Castle of Hatvan and had killed all the Ottomans housed there, including the women and children. The Ottoman Army started a siege on the fort of Eger on 21 September 1596, and by 12 October the castle had capitulated. As a retaliation to the Hatvan castle massacre, the defenders of this castle were all executed. Not long after, Ottoman command received the report that a mixed army of Austrians and Transylvanians were advancing towards the Ottoman expeditionary force. A war council was conducted under Grand Vizier Damat Ibrahim Pasha. It was decided that the Ottoman Army should march out of the Erlau castle so as to meet the Austrians at a suitable battle terrain. The Sultan thought that the Ottoman army should disengage and return to Istanbul; it was with great difficulty that he was persuaded to engage the enemy forces. The most realistic troop strength figures seem to be 40,000-50,000 for the Christian and 80,000-100,000 for the Muslim army. The Christian army had 10,000 Austrians, 4,000 Germans, 3,000 reiters, 13,000 Hungarian light cavalry and 10,000 Transylvanians, for a total of 40,000 men.\nQuestion: Were there more Transylvanians or reiters in the Christian army?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Transylvanians, \n\nPassage: Coming off their win over the Broncos the Cardinals flew to Bank of America Stadium for an NFC duel with the Panthers. In the first quarter the Cardinals trailed early as kicker John Kasay hit a 28 and a 29-yard field goal. This was followed in the second quarter by QB Jimmy Clausen completing a 16-yard touchdown pass to TE Jeff King. The Cardinals answered with kicker Jay Feely nailing a 23-yard field goal, but struggled further after Kasay made a 24 and a 43-yard field goal. The Cardinals tried to come back with Steve Breaston recovering a fumble in the end zone for a touchdown (With a failed two-point conversion) and then with Feely getting a 30-yard field goal, but the Panthers' defense was enough to secure themselves the win. With the loss, Arizona fell to 4-10, and were officially eliminated from postseason contention.\nQuestion: Which player had more field goals over 25 yards, John Kasay or Jay Feely?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: John Kasay\n\nPassage: Hoping to build on their win over Tampa Bay, the Saints stayed at home for a Week 6 fight with the Philadelphia Eagles.  In the first quarter, New Orleans jumped out to an early lead with kicker John Carney kicking a 39-yard field goal and quarterback Drew Brees completing a 14-yard touchdown pass to WR Joe Horn.  In the second quarter, Philadelphia would get on the board with kicker David Akers kicking a 47-yard field goal.  Fortunately, the Saints managed to further themselves, as Brees completed a 7-yard touchdown pass to WR Marques Colston.  However, in the third quarter, the Eagles started to get back into the game, as quarterback Donovan McNabb completed two touchdown passes (a 60-yarder to WR Reggie Brown and a 4-yard to TE L.J. Smith).  In the fourth quarter, Philadelphia took the lead on a 15-yard touchdown run by Brown.  Fortunately, after Brees completed a 48-yard touchdown pass to Horn, Carney helped give New Orleans the win as he kicked a 31-yard field goal as time ran out on the game.  With the win, the Saints maintained their lead in the NFC South with a 5-1 record going into their bye week.\nQuestion: How many field goals did David Akers kick in the first half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1\n\nPassage:  Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.

                    "Passage: The Irish Famine of 1740-1741  in the Kingdom of Ireland, was estimated to have killed between 20% and 38% of the 1740 population of 2.4 million people, the  upper estimate a proportionately greater loss than during the worst years of the Great Famine of 1845-1852. The famine of 1740-41 was due to extremely cold and then rainy weather in successive years, resulting in food losses in three categories: a series of poor grain harvests, a shortage of milk, and frost damage to potatoes. At this time, grains, particularly oats, were more important than potatoes as staples in the diet of most workers. Deaths from mass starvation in 1740-41 were compounded by an outbreak of fatal diseases. The cold and its effects extended across Europe, but mortality was higher in Ireland because both grain and potatoes failed. This is now considered by scholars to be the last serious cold period at the end of the Little Ice Age of about 1400-1800. By the mid-19th century's better-known Great Famine of 1845-1852, potatoes made up a greater portion of the Irish diets, with adverse consequences when the crops failed. This famine differed by \"cause, scale and timing:\" it was caused by an oomycete infection which destroyed much of the potato crop for several years running. The crisis was exacerbated by insufficient relief and extreme government regulations.\nQuestion: What cause the famine\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: food losses in three categories, \n\nPassage: Trying to break a two-game losing streak, the Broncos went home for a Sunday Night fight with the Seattle Seahawks.  This game would be notable for the NFL debut of QB Jay Cutler.  In the first quarter, the Broncos struck first with kicker Jason Elam's 37-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Denver's lead increased with Cutler's 7-yard TD pass to TE Stephen Alexander.  However, the Seahawks got into game with DE Darryl Tapp's 25-yard interception return for a touchdown.  After a scoreless third quarter, Seattle took control of the game with RB Shaun Alexander's 1-yard TD run, along with kicker Josh Brown's 44-yard and 23-yard field goal.  The Broncos responded with a huge play, as Cutler completed a 71-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Marshall.  However, Denver's defense couldn't hold off the Seahawks' response, as Brown nailed a 50-yard field goal, spoiling Cutler's debut.  With their third-straight loss, the Broncos fell to 7-5.\nQuestion: How many yards longer was Josh Brown's third field goal over his first one?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 6, \n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their home loss to the Jaguars, the Broncos flew to the RCA Dome for an intraconference fight with the defending-Super Bowl champions, the Indianapolis Colts.  In the first quarter, Denver galloped to an early lead with kicker Jason Elam getting a 35-yard field goal, along with QB Jay Cutler (Indiana native) complete a 7-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Marshall.  In the second quarter, the Colts responded with RB Joseph Addai got a 14-yard TD run.  The Broncos replied with Elam kicking a 22-yard field goal, yet Indianapolis took the lead with QB Peyton Manning completing a 9-yard TD pass to TE Dallas Clark. In the third quarter, Denver began to struggle as Manning got a 1-yard TD run, along with completing a 3-yard TD pass to Clark.  The Broncos got close with Cutler getting a 2-yard TD run.  However, in the fourth quarter, the Colts sealed their win with Manning completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne, along with kicker Adam Vinatieri nailing a 22-yard field goal.\nQuestion: Which player scored last in the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Adam Vinatieri\n\nPassage:  Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.

Using the kick/punt returns by returner B.J. Sams, the Ravens rallied in the second half to win. After being scoreless in the first half, RB Jamal Lewis finished with a 91-yard, 3-TD performance, ending his 35-game multi-TD drought.  QB Steve McNair completed 24 out of 34 passes for 236 yards.  The leading receiver was Mark Clayton, who had 5 receptions for 89 yards.  With the win, the Ravens improved to 8-2.\nQuestion: How many yards did Lewis run in all?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 91, \n\nPassage: Zelaya resigned on December 14, 1909, and his hand-picked successor, Jose Madriz, was elected by unanimous vote of the liberal Nicaraguan national assembly on December 20, 1909. U.S. Secretary of State Philander C. Knox admonished that the United States would not resume diplomatic relations with Nicaragua until Madriz demonstrated that his was a \"responsible government ... prepared to make reparations for the wrongs\" done to American citizens. His request for asylum granted by Mexico, Zelaya was escorted by armed guard to the Mexican gunboat General Guerrero and departed Corinto for Salina Cruz, Mexico, on the night of December 23, with Albany standing by but taking no action. As the flagship of the Nicaraguan Expeditionary Squadron, under Admiral William W. Kimball, Albany spent the next five months in Central America, mostly at Corinto, maintaining U.S. neutrality in the ongoing rebellion, sometimes under criticism by the U.S. press and business interests that were displeased by Kimball's \"friendly\" attitude toward the liberal Madriz administration. By mid-March 1909, the insurgency led by Estrada and Chamorro was seemingly collapsed and with the apparent and unexpected strength of Madriz, the U.S. Nicaraguan Expeditionary Squadron completed its withdrawal from Nicaraguan waters. On May 27, 1910, U.S. Marine Corps Major Smedley Butler arrived on the coast of Nicaragua with 250 Marines, for the purpose of providing security in Bluefields. United States Secretary of State Philander C. Knox condemned Zelaya's actions, favoring Estrada. Zelaya succumbed to U.S. political pressure and fled the country, leaving Jos\u00e9 Madriz as his successor. Madriz in turn had to face an advance by the reinvigorated eastern rebel forces, which ultimately led to his resignation. In August 1910, Juan Estrada became president of Nicaragua with the official recognition of the United States.\nQuestion: What three people were president of Nicaragua from December 1909 to August 1910?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Zelaya, Jose Madriz, Juan Estrada\n\nPassage: Following the death of Ben Jonson in 1637, Davenant was named Poet Laureate in 1638.  He was a supporter of King Charles I in the English Civil War. In 1641, before the war began, he was declared guilty of high treason by parliament along with John Suckling, after he participated in the First Army Plot, a Royalist plan to use the army to occupy London. He fled to France. Returning to join the king's army when the war started, he was knighted two years later by king Charles following the siege of Gloucester. In 1645, after the Royalist defeat at the Battle of Naseby, he retired to Paris, where he became a Roman Catholic and worked on his epic poem Gondibert. That same year he was appointed Emissary to France, and in 1649 was given the symbolic post of treasurer of the colony of Virginia by the exiled Charles II. The following year, he was made lieutenant governor of Maryland, but was captured at sea, imprisoned, and sentenced to death. He is said to have been saved by the intervention of John Milton. He spent all of 1651 in the Tower of London, where he continued writing Gondibert. On his release in 1652, he immediately published Gondibert, but he was only pardoned in 1654. In order to avoid the strict laws of censorship in force in all public places at the time, he turned a room of his home, Rutland House, into a private theatre where his works, and those of other writers considered seditious, could be performed. A performance of his The Siege of Rhodes at Rutland House in 1656 is considered to be the first performance of an English opera, and also included England's first known professional actress, Mrs Coleman.\nQuestion: Did Ben Jonson serve as Poet Laureate first, or Davenant?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Ben Jonson, \n\nPassage:  Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.

                    "Passage: Coming off their thrilling overtime win over the Packers, the Redskins stayed at home for a Week 6 interconference duel with the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday night.  Washington trailed early in the first quarter as Colts quarterback Peyton Manning completed a 57-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Pierre Gar&#231;on.  The Redskins answered with a 9-yard touchdown run from running back Ryan Torain.  Indianapolis struck back in the second quarter as Manning threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Austin Collie, followed by kicker Adam Vinatieri's 43-yard field goal. Washington began to claw back into the game in the third quarter as Torain got a 1-yard touchdown run, but the Colts continued to flex their offensive muscle as running back Joseph Addai got a 13-yard touchdown run.  The Redskins continued to stay close as kicker Graham Gano booting a 39-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Indianapolis continued to add onto their lead as Vinatieri made a 33-yard field goal.  Washington tried to rally as quarterback Donovan McNabb hooked up with running back Keiland Williams on an 8-yard touchdown pass, but the Colts' defense would prevent any further progress.\nQuestion: Which players kicked field goals in the second half of the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Graham Gano, Adam Vinatieri\n\nPassage: The Croatian Home Guard reached its maximum size at the end of 1943, when it had 130,000 men. It also included an air force, the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia , the backbone of which was provided by 500 former Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers and 1,600 NCOs with 125 aircraft. By 1943 the ZNDH was 9,775 strong and equipped with 295 aircraft.\nQuestion: How many men were in the Air Force?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2100\n\nPassage: In front of a national audience, the Eagles traveled to Foxboro as 22-point underdogs in their matchup against the 10-0 New England Patriots - the first meeting of the teams since Super Bowl XXXIX. The Eagles started A. J. Feeley due to McNabb's injury, and Asante Samuel picked off a Feeley pass and returned it 40 yards for a touchdown on the third play of the game. The Eagles responded with a 14-play drive, capped by a one-yard diving touchdown by Brian Westbrook. Tom Brady finally got a chance late in the first quarter, and marched New England down the field before Heath Evans took it in from a yard out to make it 14-7 Patriots. However, Feeley answered back with a 28-yard touchdown to third receiver Greg Lewis. Andy Reid then tried an onside kick. Hank Baskett recovered the ball, but the Eagles were forced to punt. In a ten-play drive of all pass attempts, the Patriots had first-and-goal, but settled for a field goal to take a 17-14 lead. Feeley found Lewis again on the next series, this time an 18-yard strike with three minutes left in the half, giving Philadelphia the lead. Brady connected with Jabar Gaffney to retake the lead 24-21 with seconds left in the half. A long drive by New England in the third quarter resulted in a missed field goal, and Feeley responded with a touchdown drive capped by an eight-yard reception in the end zone by Reggie Brown and the Eagles took a 28-24 lead as the game moved into the final quarter. Laurence Maroney scored from four yards out midway through the fourth as the Patriots went back on top 31-28. Feeley took the Eagles to within field goal range, but was picked off trying for a touchdown and the Patriots' perfect season survived. Feeley had 345 passing yards and three touchdowns, but his three interceptions were costly. Westbrook had 92 all-purpose yards and a touchdown, while Greg Lewis racked up a surprising 88 receiving yards and two touchdowns. The loss drops the Eagles to 5-6.\nQuestion: Who threw the longest touchdown?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: A. J. Feeley, \n\nPassage:  Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.

The Bengals' only response would be kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 40-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, New England increased its lead with Gostkowski kicking a 36-yard field goal.  Cincinnati's final response was Graham kicking a 48-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Patriots sealed the win with Brady and Moss hooking up with each other again on a 14-yard TD pass.

                    "Passage: For their annual Thanksgiving Day game, the Lions hosted a rematch with division rival the Minnesota Vikings, with both teams coming into the game at 6-4 and the winner gaining first place in the NFC North. The Lions opened the scoring in the first quarter via a two-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford to Anquan Boldin. The Vikings responded with a five-yard touchdown run from Matt Asiata. In the second quarter, the Lions recorded a 29-yard field goal from Matt Prater, which made the score 10-7 in favor of the Lions at halftime. The Vikings again tied the score in the third quarter via a 30-yard field goal from Kai Forbath, and took their first lead of the game in the fourth quarter via a 28-yard field goal from Forbath. The Lions responded with a 48-yard field goal from Prater to tie the game. With 38 seconds left in the fourth quarter, Darius Slay intercepted a pass from Sam Bradford. Two plays later, Prater recorded a 40-yard field goal as time expired, giving the Lions a 16-13 win. The Lions have trailed in the fourth quarter of every game this season, and tied an NFL record for the most fourth quarter comeback wins in a season with seven, set by the 2009 Indianapolis Colts. The Lions extended their own NFL record of games to start a season being decided by seven points or fewer, now standing at eleven.\nQuestion: How many points were scored in the second half of the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 12\n\nPassage: In 1911, the province was divided into five districts, the chief towns of which were Fergana, capital of the province (8,977 inhabitants in 1897); Andijan (49,682 in 1900); Kokand (86,704 in 1900); Namangan (61,906 in 1897); and Osh (37,397 in 1900); but Marghelan (42,855 in 1900) and Chust, Uzbekistan (13,686 in 1897) were also towns of importance.\nQuestion: Which province had more inhabitants than Chust in 1900?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Andijan, Kokand\n\nPassage: The Broncos' defense, who were the only defensive unit who had not allowed any rushing touchdowns, surrendered three rushing touchdowns, and Eagles' quarterback Carson Wentz threw four touchdown passes, in a 51-23 rout of the Broncos. The defense surrendered 50+ points for the first time since 2010, and backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, starting in place of an ineffective Trevor Siemian, threw two interceptions and nearly threw three more. The Broncos did not reach the end zone until the fourth quarter, when wide receiver Demaryius Thomas scored his first touchdown of the season &#8212; on a 1-yard pass from Osweiler, and linebacker Brandon Marshall returned a fumble 19 yards for a touchdown. Both touchdowns occurred when the game had already been decided in the Eagles' favor.\nQuestion: How many points did the Eagles win by?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 28, \n\nPassage:  Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.

This would mark the highly anticipated match-up between Denver head coach Josh McDaniels and New England's head coach Bill Belichick. The Broncos would trail in the first quarter as Patriots quarterback Tom Brady hooked up with wide receiver Wes Welker on an 8-yard touchdown pass, followed by kicker Stephen Gostkowski getting a 53-yard field goal.  Denver would answer in the second quarter as quarterback Kyle Orton connected with wide receiver Brandon Marshall on an 11-yard touchdown pass, but New England would close out the half with Brady's 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Benjamin Watson. The Broncos would tie the game in the second half as kicker Matt Prater nailed a 24-yard field goal in the third quarter, followed by Orton finding Marshall again on an 11-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter.  In overtime, Denver won possession and never relinquished possession as Prater booted the game-winning 41-yard field goal. With the win, the Broncos improved to 5-0 for the first time since the team's Super Bowl run of 1998.\nQuestion: How many yards longer was Prater's second field goal over his first one?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 17, \n\nPassage: The Vikings began their season at Cleveland Browns Stadium for a Week 1 interconference duel with the Cleveland Browns. In the first quarter, Minnesota trailed as Browns kicker Phil Dawson got a 37-yard field goal. The Vikings answered with kicker Ryan Longwell making a 21-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Minnesota took the lead as running back Adrian Peterson got a 1-yard touchdown run. Cleveland retook their lead as Dawson kicked a 20-yard field goal, along with wide receiver Joshua Cribbs returning a punt 67 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter, the Vikings took control as Peterson got a 1-yard touchdown run, along with quarterback Brett Favre completing a 6-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Percy Harvin. Afterwards, Minnesota put the game out of reach in the fourth quarter; Ryan Longwell nailed a 37-yard field goal, while Adrian Peterson got a 64-yard touchdown run. The Browns closed out the game with quarterback Brady Quinn completing a 26-yard touchdown pass to tight end Robert Royal.\nQuestion: How many touchdowns did Adrian Peterson have?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3, \n\nPassage: In a game dubbed \"The Miracle in Motown\" by Jim Nantz, the Packers trailed 20-0 at halftime before pulling off a comeback in the second half. This game is well known by Packer fans for its ending. Towards the end, the Packers tried to lateral the ball to get down the field and score a game-winning touchdown. The play looked like a total bust, as Aaron Rodgers was wrapped up and brought down, seemingly ending the game. However, the Lions were called for a controversial facemask penalty that gave the Packers one more chance on an untimed down. On the next play, Rodgers threw a 61-yard Hail Mary pass to Richard Rodgers to end the game. The ball traveled 68 yards through the air, making it the longest touchdown pass in NFL history by air. The pass gave the Packers a 27-23 win. Some Packers fans refer to this play as \"Hail Rodgers\" or \"Rodgers to Rodgers\".\nQuestion: How many points did the Lions need to tie the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 4\n\nPassage:  Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.  They would wear their alternate uniforms as they played against the New England Patriots.  In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski got a 31-yard field goal, while QB Tom Brady completed a 1-yard TD pass to LB Mike Vrabel.  In the second quarter, the Bengals managed to get on the board with QB Carson Palmer completing a 1-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh.  However, New England would respond with Brady completing a 7-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss. Near the end of the 2nd quarter, the Bengals had a chance to get closer to the Pats, but a miscommunication between Palmer and Chad Johnson resulted in a New England interception. Palmer and Johnson argued on the sidelines and all the way back to the locker room. In the third quarter, Cincinnati continued to struggle as Patriots RB Sammy Morris getting a 7-yard TD run.  The Bengals' only response would be kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 40-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, New England increased its lead with Gostkowski kicking a 36-yard field goal.  Cincinnati's final response was Graham kicking a 48-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Patriots sealed the win with Brady and Moss hooking up with each other again on a 14-yard TD pass. With their third-straight loss, the Bengals entered their bye week at 1-3.  It also marked Cincinnati's 5th loss to New England in the last 6 meetings. After the game, Marvin Lewis was heard yelling at his players for their 1-3 record. He called a team meeting a few days later and said that \"anyone who doesn't want to play shouldn't show up\".\nQuestion: Which team allowed the most first quarter points?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: Anaukpetlun would not spend his scarce resources on subjugating Siam. His strategy was to pick off Siam's peripheral regions rather than launch a full-scale invasion. On 30 November 1613, he sent a small army of 4,000  to drive out the Siamese from upper Tenasserim coast. On 26 December 1613, the army defeated the Siamese at Tavoy. The Burmese followed down to Tenasserim port itself. But the Burmese were driven back with heavy losses by the wealthy port's Portuguese broadsides in March 1614. The Siamese tried to retake Tavoy but failed. Anaukpetlun then switched theatres to Lan Na, which like Martaban before was only a nominal vassal of Siam. His armies of 17,000 invaded Lan Na on 30 April 1614 from Martaban in the south and Mone in the north. Lan Na's ruler, Thado Kyaw, desperately sought help. Help came from Lan Xang, not his overlord Siam. Despite the logistical troubles and the rainy season conditions, the Burmese armies finally achieved encirclement of Lan Na and Lan Xang forces in the Chiang Mai and Lanphun pocket in August 1614. After nearly five months, on 22 December 1614, the city surrendered. Siam would not make any attempts to recover Lan Na until 1663.\nQuestion: How many months after Anaukpetlun's army defeated the Siamese at Tavoy did his armies invade Lan Na?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 4\n\nPassage: In 1665, Bremen refused to pledge allegiance to Charles X Gustav's successor, Charles XI of Sweden. In March, the Swedish riksr\u00e5d decided to wage war. Thereupon, 12,000 Swedish troops were transferred to the Duchy of Bremen by the end of the year. In January 1666, Carl Gustaf Wrangel departed from Swedish Pomerania to command the Swedish army, which in early 1666 numbered 14,000 troops. By summer, all of the city of Bremen's territory was occupied, except the city itself. The Swedish chancellor of Bremen-Verden, Esaias von Pufendorf, went to the court in Paris to build an alliance with France. The Swedish position was that France had to intervene on the Swedish side, since Bremen was Swedish according to the Peace of Westphalia, of which France was a guarantor. Pufendorf was however told by Hugues de Lionne that France would not hesitate to declare openly that she read the treaty as Bremen being an Imperial city, rather than provoke a new great war with the Holy Roman Empire and the Dutch Republic with an assault Sweden and France could hardly win. Lionne said Sweden would be better off waiting for a situation when the Dutch and the neighboring German principalities were weak, and then take the city of Bremen by surprise.\nQuestion: How many troops were in the Swedish army in 1666 than 1665?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2000, \n\nPassage: The Seahawks began their 2008 campaign on the road against the Buffalo Bills. In the first quarter, Seattle trailed early as Bills RB Marshawn Lynch got a 21-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Seahawks continued to struggle as WR/PR Roscoe Parrish returned a punt 63 yards for a touchdown.  Seattle responded with QB Matt Hasselbeck completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Nate Burleson. Buffalo closed out the half with kicker Rian Lindell getting a 35-yard and a 38-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, the Seahawks replied with kicker Olindo Mare nailing a 45-yard field goal.  However, the Bills pulled a trick play on Seattle. Appearing to go for a 32-yard field goal, Buffalo's holder (punter Brian Moorman) instead threw a 19-yard TD pass to DE Ryan Denney. The Bills pulled away with QB Trent Edwards completing a 30-yard TD pass to TE Robert Royal.\nQuestion: Which team scored the most points?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: The Bills pulled away, with QB Trent Edwards, \n\nPassage:  Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.

Monferrato was a duchy since 1574 on the eastern side of Piedmont, and an Imperial fief since the eleventh or twelfth century. The Gonzagas had enlarged their realm with Monferrato after receiving it in dowry from the wife of duke Frederick II Gonzaga. On 22 September 1612, Francis IV, Duke of Mantua and Monferrato died at the age of 26. His death occurred only a couple of months after the death of his father Vincent I, Duke of Mantua. He left only a three-year-old daughter, Maria of Mantua. Francis IV also had two younger brothers who, both being cardinals, could not marry and were thus ineligible to succeed to Mantua's throne. Nonetheless, Francis' two brothers, Ferdinando I  and Vincenzo II , eventually did become Dukes of Mantua. Despite marrying, following the resignation of Ferdinando and the expulsion of Vincenzo from the Sacred College of Cardinals, neither produced any legitimate children. A crisis erupted when Vincenzo II died on 26 December 1627 at the age of 33, the same day that his niece Maria Gonzaga's marriage with Charles de Nevers was celebrated. Nevers was the eldest son and heir of Charles, Duke of Nevers, Rethel and Mayenne. Moreover, he was the head of the cadet branch of the House of Gonzaga, and after Vincenzo II, heir male of the Duchy of Mantua.\nQuestion: Who was the heir male of the Duchy of Mantua?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Charles de Nevers, \n\nPassage: The Steelers stayed home for a game against the Jets. In the first quarter, the Jets took an early 3-0 lead when Nick Folk kicked a 30-yard field goal. Later on, the Steelers took the lead when Ben Roethlisberger found Sammie Coates for a 72-yard touchdown pass to make it 7-3. The Jets scored 10 straight points in the second quarter: Folk kicked a 48-yard field goal to come within a point, 7-6. This would be followed byRyan Fitzpatrick finding Brandon Marshall on a 15-yard touchdown pass to make it 13-7. The Steelers wrapped up the scoring of the half when Roethlisberger found Jesse James on a 1-yard touchdown pass to make it 14-13 at halftime. In the second half it was all Steelers. Starting in the third quarter, Chris Boswell put the team up by 4 with a 47-yard field goal to make it 17-13. In the fourth quarter, they would score 2 touchdowns: Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 5-yard pass and then Coates on another 5-yard pass to make the score 24-13 and the eventual final score 31-13. With the win, the Steelers improved to 4-1. With the Ravens' loss to the Redskins, the team is also now in outright first place in the AFC North. This would be the final game the Steelers would wear their 1934 throwback uniforms.\nQuestion: How many yards was the shortest touchdown pass?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1\n\nPassage:  Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.  They would wear their alternate uniforms as they played against the New England Patriots.  In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski got a 31-yard field goal, while QB Tom Brady completed a 1-yard TD pass to LB Mike Vrabel.  In the second quarter, the Bengals managed to get on the board with QB Carson Palmer completing a 1-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh.  However, New England would respond with Brady completing a 7-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss. Near the end of the 2nd quarter, the Bengals had a chance to get closer to the Pats, but a miscommunication between Palmer and Chad Johnson resulted in a New England interception. Palmer and Johnson argued on the sidelines and all the way back to the locker room. In the third quarter, Cincinnati continued to struggle as Patriots RB Sammy Morris getting a 7-yard TD run.  The Bengals' only response would be kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 40-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, New England increased its lead with Gostkowski kicking a 36-yard field goal.  Cincinnati's final response was Graham kicking a 48-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Patriots sealed the win with Brady and Moss hooking up with each other again on a 14-yard TD pass. With their third-straight loss, the Bengals entered their bye week at 1-3.  It also marked Cincinnati's 5th loss to New England in the last 6 meetings. After the game, Marvin Lewis was heard yelling at his players for their 1-3 record. He called a team meeting a few days later and said that \"anyone who doesn't want to play shouldn't show up\".\nQuestion: How many field goals were 40 yards or over?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

In the first quarter, Denver would trail early as Browns kicker Phil Dawson got a 22-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Broncos took the lead as quarterback Kyle Orton completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tony Scheffler.  Cleveland would creep close as Dawson made a 47-yard field goal, but Denver would answer as kicker Matt Prater got a 23-yard field goal in the second quarter and a 38-yard field goal in the third quarter.  In the fourth, the Broncos pulled away as fullback Peyton Hillis got a 2-yard touchdown run and running back Correll Buckhalter got a 45-yard touchdown run.\nQuestion: Which player kicked the longest field goal of the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Phil Dawson\n\nPassage: In week 11, the Lions visited their division rival, the Chicago Bears.

The reaction of the Wayuus was unexpected. On 2 May 1769, at El Rinc\u00f3n, near Riohacha, they set their village afire, burning the church and two Spaniards who had taken refuge in it. They also captured the priest. The Spanish immediately dispatched an expedition from El Rinc\u00f3n to capture the Wayuus. At the head of this force was Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Sierra, a mestizo who had also headed the party that had taken the 22 Guajiro captives. The Guajiros recognized him and forced his party to take refuge in the house of the curate, which they then set afire. Sierra and eight of his men were killed. This success was soon known in other Guajiro areas, and more men joined the revolt. According to Mess\u00eda, at the peak there were 20,000 Wayuus under arms. Many had firearms acquired from English and Dutch smugglers, sometimes even from the Spanish. This enabled the rebels to take nearly all the settlements of the region, which they burned. According to the authorities, more than 100 Spaniards were killed and many others taken prisoner. Many cattle were also taken by the rebels. The Spaniards took refuge in Riohacha and sent urgent messages to Maracaibo, Valledupar, Santa Marta and Cartagena, the latter responding by sending 100 troops. The rebels themselves were not unified. Sierra's relatives among the Indians took up arms against the rebels to avenge his death. A battle between the two groups of Wayuus was fought at La Soledad. That and the arrival of the Spanish reinforcements caused the rebellion to fade away, but not before the Guajiro had regained much territory.\nQuestion: Between the Guajiro and the spansish, who suffered the most casualties?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: spansiards, \n\nPassage:  Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.  They would wear their alternate uniforms as they played against the New England Patriots.  In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski got a 31-yard field goal, while QB Tom Brady completed a 1-yard TD pass to LB Mike Vrabel.  In the second quarter, the Bengals managed to get on the board with QB Carson Palmer completing a 1-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh.  However, New England would respond with Brady completing a 7-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss. Near the end of the 2nd quarter, the Bengals had a chance to get closer to the Pats, but a miscommunication between Palmer and Chad Johnson resulted in a New England interception. Palmer and Johnson argued on the sidelines and all the way back to the locker room. In the third quarter, Cincinnati continued to struggle as Patriots RB Sammy Morris getting a 7-yard TD run.  The Bengals' only response would be kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 40-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, New England increased its lead with Gostkowski kicking a 36-yard field goal.  Cincinnati's final response was Graham kicking a 48-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Patriots sealed the win with Brady and Moss hooking up with each other again on a 14-yard TD pass. With their third-straight loss, the Bengals entered their bye week at 1-3.  It also marked Cincinnati's 5th loss to New England in the last 6 meetings.

On 23 February 1763, slaves on Plantation Magdalenenberg on the Canje River in Berbice rebelled, protesting harsh and inhumane treatment. They torched the plantation house, then went to other plantations to mobilize other enslaved Africans to join the rebellion. Cuffy, an enslaved man at Lilienburg, another plantation on Canje, is said to have organized them into a military unit. As plantation after plantation fell to the slaves, the Dutch settlers fled northward and the rebels began to take over control of the region. For almost a year, the rebels held on to southern Berbice, while the whites were able to hold on to the north. Eventually only about half of the white population that had lived in the colony remained. The rebels came to number about 3,000 and threatened European control over the Guianas. Other key figures among the rebels include Atta, Accara, and Accabre. The insurgents were eventually defeated in the spring of 1764 with the assistance of troops from neighbouring French and British colonies and from Europe.\nQuestion: How many years did the rebels hold on to southern Berbice for?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1, \n\nPassage:  Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.

                    "Passage: A September 2014 Lucid Talk Belfast Telegraph poll showed that 40.1% of the population supported same-sex marriage, while 39.4% opposed and 20.5% either had or stated no opinion. Of those that gave an opinion, 50.5% supported and 49.5% opposed same-sex marriage. A poll in May 2015 found that 68% of the population supported same-sex marriage, with support rising to 75% in Belfast. A \"mass rally\", organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Amnesty International, and the Rainbow Project took place in Belfast on 13 June 2015, with a 20,000 person turnout. A June 2016 poll gave support for same-sex marriage at 70%, while those opposing it at 22%.\nQuestion: As of the June 2016 poll, in percent, how many more people supported same-sex marriage than opposed it?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 48\n\nPassage:  Hoping to snap a four-game losing streak, the Broncos traveled to the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, for an AFC West divisional rematch with the Oakland Raiders. In the first quarter, the Raiders grabbed the early lead, with a 71-yard touchdown run by wide receiver Jacoby Ford. The Broncos responded, when quarterback Tim Tebow, starting in place of an injured Kyle Orton, scrambled for a 40-yard touchdown run. The Broncos grabbed the lead, when Tebow threw a 33-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brandon Lloyd, but the Raiders responded, with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Michael Bush. In the second quarter, the Broncos lead again, with a 46-yard field goal by placekicker Steven Hauschka, but the Raiders would tie the game, with a 49-yard field goal by placekicker Sebastian Janikowski just before halftime. In the third quarter, the Raiders grabbed the lead, with a 35-yard field goal by Janikowski. The Broncos responded, with a 35-yard field goal by Hauschka. Oakland lead again, with a 47-yard field goal by Janikowski. In the fourth quarter, the Raiders widened their lead, when quarterback Jason Campbell threw a 73-yard touchdown pass to fullback Marcel Reece. The Broncos narrowed the lead, with a 45-yard field goal by Hauschka, but the Raiders pulled away, when linebacker Quentin Groves tackled running back Correll Buckhalter in the end zone for a safety, followed by a 1-yard touchdown by Bush. With the loss, the Broncos tied their franchise record for losses in a single season. This would also be the Broncos last road loss to a division opponent until Week 6 of the 2016 season.\nQuestion: How many yards separated the longest touchdown from the next longest?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2\n\nPassage: Philip the Good, the new Duke of Burgundy, then entered into an alliance with the English, which resulted in the Treaty of Troyes. This treaty disinherited the Dauphin Charles and handed the succession to Henry V through a marriage to Charles VI's daughter, Catherine of Valois. The treaty named Henry \"regent and heir of France\"  until Charles's death. The treaty was denounced by the Armagnacs, who reasoned \"that the king belongs to the crown and not vice versa\". Despite his expectations, Henry V predeceased his sickly father-in-law by a few months, in 1422. In 1429, the intervention of Joan of Arc culminated in a successful coronation campaign that allowed Charles VII to be crowned at Reims Cathedral, the traditional coronation site of French kings, on 17 July 1429. The nine-year-old Henry VI of England was crowned as King of France on 16 December 1431 at Notre-Dame de Paris.\nQuestion: Which place was Henry VI of England NOT crowned at, the Reims Cathedral or Notre-Dame de Paris?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Reims Cathedral, \n\nPassage: The total number of active military personnel in the Croatian Armed Forces stands at 14,506 and 6,000 reserves working in various service branches of the armed forces.

                    "Passage:  Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Chargers, the Raiders flew to Arrowhead Stadium for a Week 2 AFC West duel with the Kansas City Chiefs.  Oakland would trail in the first quarter as Chiefs kicker Ryan Succop got a 23-yard field goal.  The Raiders would tie the game in the second quarter as kicker Sebastian Janikowski got a 48-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, Oakland took the lead as Janikowski nailed a 54-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Kansas City took the lead as quarterback Matt Cassel completed a 29-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Dwayne Bowe.  Afterwards, Oakland claimed victory as running back Darren McFadden got the game-winning 5-yard touchdown run.\nQuestion: How many total field goals did Janikowski make in the 2nd and 3rd quarter?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2\n\nPassage: In week 4, the Lions traveled south to Arlington, Texas to take on the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys dominated the first half, putting the Lions in a big hole for the second straight week. First came a 25-yard touchdown catch by Dez Bryant. In the second quarter, Bryant scored again on a 6-yard touchdown catch. Dallas added more points with a 41-yard field goal by Dan Bailey. The Lions then got their only points of the first half with a 33-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. The Cowboys responded with a 35-yard field goal just before halftime. After the break, Dallas added more points with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Jason Witten, putting them up 27-3. The Lions responded with two consecutive defensive touchdowns: first a 34-yard interception return by Bobby Carpenter, then a 56-yard pick-6 by Chris Houston. The Cowboys scored their final points of the game with a 23-yard field goal late in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Lions continued their comeback with a 23-yard touchdown catch by Calvin Johnson. They made it a three-point game with a 51-yard field goal by Jason Hanson, then Romo threw an interception to Stephen Tulloch, and took their first lead of the game late in the final quarter when Calvin Johnson caught his second touchdown of the game from 2 yards out to become only the second player in NFL history to record at least two touchdown catches in 4 straight games (the other to do so is former Vikings receiver Cris Carter). The Lions defense held off Dallas for the win. Like the previous week, the Lions came back and won it in the final moments of the game after being down by a large margin at halftime. This was also the largest comeback the Dallas Cowboys have ever allowed, and it is the largest comeback by a road team in NFL history as the Cowboys were up by 24 in the 3rd quarter. It was the first time the Lions started 4-0 since 1980. This also was its franchise-record fifth straight road win. Ironically, their last game at Dallas saw the Lions lose their franchise-record 26th straight road game.\nQuestion: What are the top two longest field goals made?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 51-yard, 41-yard\n\nPassage: The Ottoman Empire often treated POWs poorly. Some 11,800 British Empire soldiers, most of them Indians, became prisoners after the Siege of Kut in Mesopotamia in April 1916; 4,250 died in captivity. Although many were in a poor condition when captured, Ottoman officers forced them to march 1,100 kilometres  to Anatolia. A survivor said: \"We were driven along like beasts; to drop out was to die.\" The survivors were then forced to build a railway through the Taurus Mountains. In Russia, when the prisoners from the Czech Legion of the Austro-Hungarian army were released in 1917, they re-armed themselves and briefly became a military and diplomatic force during the Russian Civil War. While the Allied prisoners of the Central Powers were quickly sent home at the end of active hostilities, the same treatment was not granted to Central Power prisoners of the Allies and Russia, many of whom served as forced labour, e.g., in France until 1920. They were released only after many approaches by the Red Cross to the Allied Supreme Council. German prisoners were still being held in Russia as late as 1924.\nQuestion: Who built a railway through the Taurus Mountains?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: British Empire soldiers, \n\nPassage: The total number of active military personnel in the Croatian Armed Forces stands at 14,506 and 6,000 reserves working in various service branches of the armed forces. In May 2016, Armed Forces had 16,019 members, of which 14,506 were active military personnel and 1,513 civil servants. Of the 14,506 active military personnel, 3,183 were officers, 5,389 non-commissioned officers, 5,393 soldiers, 520 military specialists, 337 civil servants and 1,176 other employees.\nQuestion: How many more active military personnel were in the Armed Forces than civil servants?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: Next, the Lions stayed at home for a Week 14 NFC North rematch with newly signed veteran quarterback Daunte Culpepper's former team, the Minnesota Vikings.  In the first quarter, Detroit was on the board first as kicker Jason Hanson got a 25-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Lions increased their lead as Hanson got a 23-yard field goal. The Vikings would close out the half as kicker Ryan Longwell got a 35-yard field goal. During the first half, Moran Norris was ejected by referee Jerome Boger for throwing a punch at Minnesota's Napoleon Harris. In the third quarter, Minnesota took the lead as RB Chester Taylor got a 17-yard TD run. Detroit would respond with former Vikings QB Daunte Culpepper completing a 70-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson. However, Minnesota got the lead again as QB Tarvaris Jackson completed an 11-yard TD pass to TE Visanthe Shiancoe.  In the fourth quarter, the Lions tried to rally as Hanson made a 39-yard field goal.  However, the Vikings pulled away as Longwell nailed a 50-yard field goal.\nQuestion: Which player scored the second longest field goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Jason Hanson\n\nPassage: The Chiefs led for the first time all season in this game with a first-quarter touchdown which gave them the lead 7-0.  After relinquishing the lead, the Chiefs  tied the game at 13-13 at the end of regulation to force overtime.  However, despite the fact that they got the ball in overtime, QB Matt Cassel was picked off by Lamarr Woodley and the ball was returned to the Chiefs' 5-Yard line setting up the game-winning field goal for the Steelers as the Chiefs lost the game 16-13 and their record dropped to 1-8.\nQuestion: How many points did the Chiefs lead by at the end of the first quarter?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 7, \n\nPassage: The economic costs of the war were also high. As their forces abandoned their fixed positions in July-August 1922, the Republicans burned many of the administrative buildings and businesses that they had been occupying. In addition, their subsequent guerrilla campaign caused much destruction and the economy of the Free State suffered a hard blow in the earliest days of its existence as a result. The material damage caused by the war to property came to over \u00a330 million. Particularly damaging to the Free State's economy was the systematic destruction of railway infrastructure and roads by the Republicans. In addition, the cost to the Free State of waging the war came to another \u00a317 million. By September 1923, Deputy Hogan estimated the cost at \u00a350 million. The new State ended 1923 with a budget deficit of over \u00a34 million. This weakened financial situation meant that the new state could not pay its share of Imperial debt under the treaty. This adversely affected the boundary negotiations in 1924-25, in which the Free State government acquiesced that border with Northern Ireland would remain unchanged in exchange for forgiveness of the Imperial debt. Further, the state undertook to pay for damage caused to property between the truce of July 1921 and the end of the Civil War; W.T. Cosgrave told the D\u00e1il:\nQuestion: How many million did the war cost?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 17, \n\nPassage: The total number of active military personnel in the Croatian Armed Forces stands at 14,506 and 6,000 reserves working in various service branches of the armed forces.

                    "Passage: From the 12th century Nuremberg Castle was the seat of the Burgraviate of Nuremberg. The burgraviate was ruled from about 1190 by the Zollerns, the Franconian line of the later House of Hohenzollern, which provided the German emperors of the 19th and 20th century. Under the Hohenstaufen kings, Conrad\u00a0III and Frederick Barbarossa, Franconia became the centre of power in the Empire. During the time when there was no emperor, the Interregnum , some territorial princes became ever more powerful. After the Interregnum, however, the rulers succeeded in re-establishing a stronger royal lordship in Franconia. Franconia soon played an important role again for the monarchy at the time of Rudolf of Habsburg; the itineraries of his successors showing their preference for the Rhine-Main region. In 1376 the Swabian League of Cities was founded and was joined later by several Franconian imperial cities. During the 13th\u00a0century the Teutonic Order was formed, taking over its first possession in Franconia in 1209, the Bailiwick of Franconia. The foundation of many schools and hospitals and the construction of numerous churches and castles in this area goes back to the work of this Roman Catholic military order. The residence place of the bailiwick was at Ellingen until 1789 when it was transferred to today's Bad Mergentheim. Other orders such as the Knights Templar could not gain a foothold in Franconia; the Order of St. John worked in the Bishopric of W\u00fcrzburg and had short term commands.\nQuestion: How many years ago was the bailiwick moved to Bad Mergentheim?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 229, \n\nPassage: Coming off their divisional win over the Buccaneers, the Falcons stayed at home, donned their throwback uniforms, and played their Week 10 interconference duel with the Baltimore Ravens on Thursday night.  After a scoreless first quarter, Atlanta delivered the opening punch in the second quarter as quarterback Matt Ryan found running back Jason Snelling on a 28-yard touchdown run, followed by a 28-yard field goal from kicker Matt Bryant. The Falcons added onto their lead in the third quarter as a Brent Grimes interception set up Bryant booted a 51-yard field goal.  The Ravens would answer with quarterback Joe Flacco completing a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Anquan Boldin.  Atlanta struck back in the fourth quarter as Ryan found wide receiver Roddy White on a 4-yard touchdown pass.  Baltimore took the lead as Flacco completed a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Derrick Mason, followed by a 9-yard touchdown pass to tight end Todd Heap, with 1:05 left. However, a 24-yard completion to Michael Jenkins and Ravens penalties set the Falcons up at the Ravens 33-yard line. Then, Ryan connected with White again on a 33-yard touchdown pass (with a failed two-point conversion) with 20 seconds left in the game, giving the Falcons a 26-21 lead. Flacco attempted a miracle win, but his last pass to T.J. Houshmendazeh was fumbled with 0:02 seconds left. During halftime, Deion Sanders was inducted into the Falcons Ring of Honor.\nQuestion: How many points were scored in the first quarter by both teams?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 0, \n\nPassage: Still trying to get their first win, the Dolphins flew to Wembley Stadium for their special international interconference game against the New York Giants.  For the game, Miami was listed as the home team.  In the first quarter, the Dolphins trailed early as Giants kicker Lawrence Tynes nailed a 20-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Miami's struggles continued with N.Y. QB Eli Manning getting a 10-yard TD run, along with Tynes nailing a 41-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the 'Fins started to make a comeback as former Giants kicker Jay Feely got a 29-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, Miami drew close as QB Cleo Lemon completing a 21-yard TD pass to rookie WR Ted Ginn, Jr.  However, New York managed to hold on to their lead for the win. With their 11th-straight loss, the Dolphins entered their bye week at 0-8.\nQuestion: Of the three field goals that were kicked during the game how many of them were over 25 yards?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2\n\nPassage: The total number of active military personnel in the Croatian Armed Forces stands at 14,506 and 6,000 reserves working in various service branches of the armed forces.

                    "Passage: On the Jets' second play of the game, Ryan Fitzpatrick was strip-sacked by Jones with Hightower recovering at the Jets 19. The Patriots didn't gain a single yard, but Gostkowski gave the Patriots the lead on a 38-yard field goal. The Jets countered with a 15 play drive all the way to the Patriots 2-yard line, but were forced to settle for a 20-yard field goal by Nick Folk. After a Patriots punt, the Jets strung together a 14 play, 83-yard drive scoring on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Jeremy Kerley, giving the Jets a 10-3 lead in the second quarter. A few possessions later, the Patriots marched 47 yards, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run by Brady on 4th-and-Goal, tying the game. After a Jets punt, Edelman gave the Patriots a good start with a 17-yard return to the Patriots 41. The Patriots drove to the Jets 20, but an 8-yard sack by Calvin Pace forced the Patriots to settle for a 47-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 13-10 lead at halftime. After Amendola returned the opening kickoff 28 yards to the Jets 29, the Patriots drove all the way to the Jets 6, but were forced to settle for another field goal, increasing the lead to 16-10. The Jets countered with a 13 play, 80-yard drive, taking seven minutes off the clock, scoring on a 9-yard pass to Chris Ivory, giving the Jets a 17-16 lead. After a Patriots punt, the Jets drove all the way to the Jets 12, but settled for a 30-yard field goal by Folk, increasing their lead to 20-16 a few minutes into the fourth quarter. The Patriots countered with a 10 play, 80-yard march, scoring on an 8-yard touchdown pass to Amendola, retaking the lead 23-20. After the Jets punted, the Patriots scored again, with Brady's 15-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski widening their lead to 30-20 with just 1:13 remaining. The Jets drove to the Patriots 37 and Folk trimmed the deficit to 30-23 with a 55-yard field goal with just 0:18 seconds left. Brandon Marshall recovered the onside kick at the Patriots 49 with 14 seconds left, giving the Jets a chance to tie game. After a 12-yard catch by Eric Decker, Marshall was flagged for a false start, allowing the clock to run out and end the game.\nQuestion: How many field goals were made in the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 6, \n\nPassage: The War of the J\u00fclich Succession  was a military conflict over the right of succession to the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg. It lasted between 10 June 1609 and 24 October 1610, resuming in May 1614 and finally ending in 13 October 1614. The first round of the conflict pitted Catholic Archduke Leopold V against the combined forces of the Protestant Margraviate of Brandenburg and Palatinate-Neuburg, ending in the former's military defeat. The representatives of the Brandenburg and Neuburg later entered into a direct conflict after their religious conversion to Calvinism and Catholicism respectively. The conflict was further complicated by the involvement of Spain and the Netherlands making it part of the Eighty Years' War. It was finally settled by the Treaty of Xanten, provisions of which favored Spain.\nQuestion: In which year did the War of the J\u00fclich Succession start, 1609, 1610, 1614?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1609, \n\nPassage: Following two consecutive losses to Dallas and San Diego, Philadelphia went to Chicago to take on the Chicago Bears, who were 4-5, on Sunday Night Football. The Eagles dominated the first quarter as Philadelphia took a two score lead on a 25-yard field goal by David Akers and a 13-yard touchdown from Donovan McNabb to Jason Avant on a wide receiver screen pass. Down 10-0 at the start of the second quarter, Chicago drove within one point as Bears kicker Robbie Gould successfully made a 45-yard field goal, as well as a pair of 28-yard field goals, to make the score 10-9 at the half. In the second half, the Bears took the lead as Robbie Gould kicked his fourth field goal, a 49-yarder that put Chicago up 12-10. However, it took only 30 seconds for the Eagles to take the lead as Donovan McNabb passed to DeSean Jackson for a 48-yard touchdown to give the Eagles a 17-12 lead. Ironically, the 48-yard touchdown catch was the shortest touchdown scored by Jackson thus far in the season. Chicago again took the lead in the third quarter as struggling quarterback Jay Cutler, who had already missed several wide open targets in the game, passed to tight end Kellen Davis for a 15-yard score. The Bears converted the 2-point conversion attempt as running back Matt Forte scored on the pass from Cutler to put the Bears back on top 20-17. In the fourth quarter, both defenses fought back and forth but the only points of the final period were scored by Eagles running back LeSean McCoy on a 10-yard, game-winning touchdown run to put the Eagles up 24-20, the game's final score. With the win, the Eagles improved to 6-4. Ironically, the Eagles win came by the same score (24-20) in the same city (Chicago) at the same time and venue (Sunday Night Football on NBC) as when they had lost in week 4 of the 2008 season.\nQuestion: How many field goals did Gould kick in the first half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3, \n\nPassage: The total number of active military personnel in the Croatian Armed Forces stands at 14,506 and 6,000 reserves working in various service branches of the armed forces.

                    "Passage: The Cardinals' third game was an Interconference duel with the Raiders. The Cardinals led early in the first quarter when RB LaRod Stephens-Howling returned a kickoff from his own goal line to the endzone running 102 yards for a touchdown. The Raiders replied and took the lead with QB Bruce Gradkowski completing a 22-yard touchdown pass to TE Zach Miller, followed by kicker Sebastian Janikowski making a 22-yard field goal. Arizona replied with kicker Jay Feely kicking a 42-yard field goal. Then the Raiders replied with Janikowski making a 54-yard field goal. The Cardinals took the lead in the 2nd quarter when QB Derek Anderson made a 2-yard TD pass to WR Steve Breaston, but it didn't last very long after RB Darren McFadden got a 2-yard TD run. Arizona got the lead back in the 3rd quarter when Anderson found WR Larry Fitzgerald on an 8-yard TD pass. In the 4th quarter Oakland cut the lead when Janikowski made a 23-yard field goal. Janikowski missed three field goals in the game, giving Arizona the win.\nQuestion: How many yards were Sebastian Janikowski's field goals on average?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 33\n\nPassage: Real GDP per capita (measured in 2009 dollars) was $52,444 in 2017 and has been growing each year since 2010. It grew 3.0% per year on average in the 1960s, 2.1% in the 1970s, 2.4% in the 1980s, 2.2% in the 1990s, 0.7% in the 2000s, and 0.9% from 2010 to 2017. Reasons for slower growth since 2000 are debated by economists and may include aging demographics, slower population and growth in labor force, slower productivity growth, reduced corporate investment, greater income inequality reducing demand, lack of major innovations, and reduced labor power. The U.S. ranked 20th out of 220 countries in GDP per capita in 2017.  Among the modern U.S. Presidents, Bill Clinton had the highest cumulative percent real GDP increase during his two terms, Reagan second and Obama third.\nQuestion: Which President had the lowest GDP cumulative percent?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Obama\n\nPassage: The Eagles kicked off the 2017 season on the road against the Redskins. The Eagles started off with two TD passes from Carson Wentz to give them a 13-0 lead. (Kicker Caleb Sturgis missed an extra point after the 2nd TD.) However, the Redskins came back with a Ryan Kerrigan pick six and a TD pass from Kirk Cousins to RB Chris Thompson to give them a 14-13 lead late in second quarter. The Eagles responded with a field goal to give them a 16-14 lead at the half. The third quarter only consisted of field goals. The Eagles led 22-17 at the end of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Kirk Cousins fumbled the ball which Eagles' DE Fletcher Cox recovered for a TD to seal an Eagles victory. This was the Eagles first win against the Redskins since September 2014, ending a five-game losing streak to their division rival. With the win, the Eagles started 1-0 for the sixth time in their last seven season openers.\nQuestion: what was the score at the end of the second quarter?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 16-14, \n\nPassage: The total number of active military personnel in the Croatian Armed Forces stands at 14,506 and 6,000 reserves working in various service branches of the armed forces.

The population density was 259 people per square mile (100/km\u00b2).  There were 148,350 housing units, at an average density of 74 per square mile (29/km\u00b2). The countys racial makeup was 89.4% Race (United States Census), 0.5% Black or African American, 0.6% American Indian or Alaska Native, 1.4% Asian, 0.8% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 4.6% some other race, and 2.7% from two or more races. 10.8% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\nQuestion: How many percent of people were not white?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 10.6\n\nPassage: The first successful use of poison gas as a weapon of warfare occurred during the Second Battle of Ypres . Gas was soon used by all major belligerents throughout the war. It is estimated that the use of chemical weapons employed by both sides throughout the war had inflicted 1.3 million casualties. For example, the British had over 180,000 chemical weapons casualties during the war, and up to one-third of American casualties were caused by them. The Russian Army reportedly suffered roughly 500,000 chemical weapon casualties in World War I. The use of chemical weapons in warfare was in direct violation of the 1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases and the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, which prohibited their use. The effect of poison gas was not limited to combatants. Civilians were at risk from the gases as winds blew the poison gases through their towns, and they rarely received warnings or alerts of potential danger. In addition to absent warning systems, civilians often did not have access to effective gas masks. An estimated 100,000-260,000 civilian casualties were caused by chemical weapons during the conflict and tens of thousands more  died from scarring of the lungs, skin damage, and cerebral damage in the years after the conflict ended. Many commanders on both sides knew such weapons would cause major harm to civilians but nonetheless continued to use them. British Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig wrote in his diary, \"My officers and I were aware that such weapons would cause harm to women and children living in nearby towns, as strong winds were common in the battlefront. However, because the weapon was to be directed against the enemy, none of us were overly concerned at all.\"\nQuestion: Which happened last, the Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases or the Hague Convention on Land Warfare?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: he 1899 Hague Declaration, Concerning Asphyxiating Gases, the 1907 Hague Convention, on Land Warfare,, \n\nPassage: During the closing ceremony of the 2013 Southeast Asian Games, the SEAGF Flag was formally handed over from Myanmar to Singapore.

On 27 June 2014, a series of festivities were held at the Singapore Sports Hub, including a fireworks display, to mark the one year countdown to the games. The Sports Hub Community Open House was held in conjunction with the launch to introduce the new sports facilities to the general public. The countdown to the games began on 15 February 2014 with a launch party at the Gardens by the Bay, where the logo, theme and mascot were also introduced. 800 Nanyang Polytechnic students organised a major countdown event on 11 April 2015 to mark the final 50 days in a few days, where about 4,000 people turned up to attend a concert and a sports carnival. On 16 April 2015, the 50-day countdown began with various organisations stacking a number each through a video tribute.

                    "Passage: The Cowboys began their 2007 campaign at home against their NFC East rival, the New York Giants.  In the first quarter, Dallas trailed early as QB Eli Manning completed a 60-yard TD pass to WR Plaxico Burress to give New York an early 6-0 lead (botched hold on PAT).  Afterwards, the Cowboys got on the board with rookie kicker Nick Folk getting a 31-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Dallas took the lead with RB Marion Barber getting an 18-yard TD run, while QB Tony Romo completed an 18-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten.  Afterwards, the Giants would end up trailing by one at halftime, as Manning & Burress hooked up with each other again on a 4-yard TD pass, while kicker Lawrence Tynes got a 44-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Dallas responded with Romo completing a 22-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.  New York would climb back with Tynes kicking a 48-yard field goal, but the Cowboys answered with Romo running into the end zone from 9 yards out.  In the fourth quarter, the Giants managed to try to come back with Tynes' 24-yard field goal, yet Dallas would reply with Romo & Owens hooking up with each other again on a 47-yard TD pass.  Just when it looked like New York was drawing closer with Manning's 9-yard TD pass to RB Derrick Ward (with a failed 2-point conversion) and his 10-yard TD pass to Burress, the Cowboys sealed the win with Romo completing a 51-yard TD pass to WR Sam Hurd.\nQuestion: From what yardline did both teams score a touchdown?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 9-yard\n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Cardinals, the Browns flew to The Meadowlands for a Week 14 intraconference duel with the New York Jets.

The Jets would reply with kicker Mike Nugent getting a 35-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Browns continued their recent success with Anderson completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards. New York would answer with Nugent kicking a 41-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Cleveland increased its lead with kicker Phil Dawson getting a 49-yard field goal. The Jets tried to come back as QB Kellen Clemens managed to get a 1-yard TD run, while Nugent kicked a 38-yard field goal. Afterwards, Cleveland pulled away as Lewis got a 31-yard TD run.

                    "Passage: Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Cardinals, the Texas flew to Paul Brown Stadium for a Week 6 duel with the Cincinnati Bengals.  Houston would get off to a fast first quarter start as quarterback Matt Schaub found tight end Owen Daniels on a 12-yard touchdown pass.  The Bengals answered in the second quarter with a 10-yard touchdown run from running back Cedric Benson, yet the Texans would reply with Schaub completing a 38-yard touchdown pass to running back Steve Slaton.  Cincinnati would close out the half with quarterback Carson Palmer's 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Laveranues Coles, followed by kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 50-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Houston stormed right back with Schaub completing a 23-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jacoby Jones and a 7-yard touchdown pass to Daniels.  Afterwards, the defense held to preserve the 11-point lead.\nQuestion: How many points did the Texans win by?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 11\n\nPassage: At its inauguration in 1873, the Preakness carried a value of $1,000. The first major increase occurred in 1919 when the race had a $25,000 value. It climbed to $100,000 in 1946 and in 1959 was raised to $150,000. Subsequent increases occurred from 1979 to 1989, when the purse rose four times from $200,000 to $500,000, before going to $1 million in 1997. On December 12, 2013, the Maryland Jockey Club announced for the 2014 running of the Preakness the purse would be increased from $1,000,000 to $1,500,000.\nQuestion: For how many years was the Preakness race value at $25,000 before it increased to $100,000?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 27, \n\nPassage: The Kaga Rebellion or Ch\u014dky\u014d Uprising was a large-scale revolt in Kaga Province , Japan, in late 1487 through 1488. Togashi Masachika, who ruled Kaga Province as shugo, had been restored to power in 1473 with aid from the Asakura clan as well as the Ikk\u014d-ikki, a loose collection of lesser nobility, monks, and farmers. By 1474, however, the Ikk\u014d-ikki grew discontent with Masachika, and launched some initial revolts, which were easily quelled. In 1487, when Masachika left on a military campaign, between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand Ikk\u014d-ikki revolted. Masachika returned with his army, but the Ikk\u014d-ikki, backed by several disaffected vassal families, overwhelmed his army and surrounded him in his palace, where he committed seppuku. The former vassals of Masachika granted the position of shugo to Masachika's uncle Yasutaka, but over the next several decades, the Ikk\u014d-ikki increased their political hold on the province, which they would effectively control for almost a century.\nQuestion: How many years did the revolt in Kaga Province last?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1, \n\nPassage: The total number of active military personnel in the Croatian Armed Forces stands at 14,506 and 6,000 reserves working in various service branches of the armed forces.

Later on, the Steelers took the lead when Ben Roethlisberger found Sammie Coates for a 72-yard touchdown pass to make it 7-3. The Jets scored 10 straight points in the second quarter: Folk kicked a 48-yard field goal to come within a point, 7-6. This would be followed byRyan Fitzpatrick finding Brandon Marshall on a 15-yard touchdown pass to make it 13-7. The Steelers wrapped up the scoring of the half when Roethlisberger found Jesse James on a 1-yard touchdown pass to make it 14-13 at halftime. In the second half it was all Steelers. Starting in the third quarter, Chris Boswell put the team up by 4 with a 47-yard field goal to make it 17-13. In the fourth quarter, they would score 2 touchdowns: Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 5-yard pass and then Coates on another 5-yard pass to make the score 24-13 and the eventual final score 31-13. With the win, the Steelers improved to 4-1. With the Ravens' loss to the Redskins, the team is also now in outright first place in the AFC North. This would be the final game the Steelers would wear their 1934 throwback uniforms.\nQuestion: How many field goals did Nick Folk score in the first quarter?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1\n\nPassage: Starting lineups: HOUSTON - OFFENSE: QB Matt Schaub, LT Duane Brown, LG Wade Smith, C Chris Myers, RG Mike Brisiel, RT Eric Winston, WR Andre Johnson, RB Arian Foster, FB Vonta Leach, TE Joel Dreessen, WR Kevin Walter.Hoping to snap a four-game losing streak the Texans played on home ground for an AFC South rivalry match against the Titans.

In addition to their traditional AFC East rivals, the team played opponents from the AFC South and NFC South divisions, and the third-place teams of the AFC West and AFC North, as determined by the NFL scheduling formula. Their schedule was released in full on April 14. Game times and channels from weeks 11, 12, and 14-17 were subject to change per the NFL's flexible scheduling policy. Some controversy ensued over the placement of the Jets' first two home games, coinciding with the Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. In response, the NFL moved the time of the game against the Tennessee Titans to 1:00&#160;pm Eastern. The Jets played a regular season game outside the United States for the first time when they played the Bills in Toronto; the game is the second in a five-year series of regular and preseason games the Bills are playing at the Rogers Centre.

                    "Passage: (2012 Detroit Lions season) After defeating the Jaguars at home in overtime, the Texans traveled to Detroit to play in their first ever Thanksgiving Day game.  Many touchdowns were scored between both of the teams, but the Texans got the better edge of it when Justin Forsett ran for a controversial touchdown from deep in the Texans' territory.  With their 2nd-straight overtime victory, the Texans improved to 10-1, 1-0 on Thanksgiving, and 2-1 against the Lions all-time. Mikel Leshore of Detroit struck first to make it 7-0. In the 2nd,   Arian Foster scored to make it 7-7. Mike Thomas caught to make it 14-7 Detroit. Matt Schaub then hit Owen Daniels to make it 14-14. 2 plays later Calvin Johnson caught it to make it 21-14 Lions at the half. Jason Hanson made one to make it 24-14. Then Justin Forsett scored on an 81-yard run that clearly showed that Forsett was down by contact, but was illegally challenged; it  made it 24-21. Shayne Graham would follow suit with a 45-yard FG to tie it at 24, but Detroit would retake the lead early in the 4th quarter with a Joique Bell 23-yard TD run to make the score 31-24. Foster scored his 2nd TD late in regulation to tie the game at 31. The Texans got the last laugh as Graham would nail the 32-yard game-winner with 2:21 left in overtime to win the game 34-31.\nQuestion: who did the Texans play?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Jaguars, \n\nPassage: The original PowerBook 100, 140, and 170 were replaced by the PowerBook 145 (updated to the PowerBook 145B in 1993), PowerBook 160, and PowerBook 180 in 1992. The 160 and 180 having video output allowing them to drive an external monitor. In addition, the PowerBook 180 had a superb-for-the-time active-matrix grayscale display, making it popular with the Mac press. In 1993, the PowerBook 160 was the first PowerBook with a color screen, later followed by the PowerBook 180. In 1994, the last true member of the 100-series form factor introduced was the PowerBook 150, targeted at value-minded consumers and students. The PowerBook 190, released in 1995, bears no resemblance to the rest of the PowerBook 100 series, and is in fact simply a Motorola 68LC040-based version of the PowerBook 5300 (and the last Macintosh model to utilize a Motorola 68k-family processor). Like the 190, however, the 150 also used the 5300 Integrated Drive Electronics-based logic-board architecture. From the 100s 68000 processor, to the 190s 68LC040 processor, the 100 series PowerBooks span the entire Apple 68K line, with the 190 even upgradable to a PowerPC processor.\nQuestion: How many powerbooks used the Integrated Drive Electronics-based logic-board architecture?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2\n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their Sunday night home loss to the Saints, the Cowboys flew to the Georgia Dome for a Saturday night fight with the Atlanta Falcons.  In the first quarter, Dallas took an early lead with QB Tony Romo completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Cowboys increased its lead as on the very first play, OLB DeMarcus Ware returned an interception 41 yards for a touchdown.  However, the Falcons started to fight back with QB Michael Vick completing a 1-yard TD pass to FB Justin Griffith and a 9-yard TD pass to WR Michael Jenkins.  Fortunately, the 'Boys struck back with Romo and Owens hooking up with each other again with a 51-yard TD pass.  Yet again, Atlanta fought back with Vick completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Ashley Lelie.  In the third quarter, Dallas temporarily fell behind with Vick completing 5-yard TD pass to Griffith.  Afterwards, the Cowboys regained control with kicker Martin Gramatica's 48-yard field goal and RB Marion Barber 9-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Barber helped the Cowboys wrap the game up with a 3-yard TD run.  With the win, the 'Boys improved to 9-5 and put themselves in position to clinch a playoff berth following the day.Stats\nQuestion: How many touchdowns did Michael Vick throw?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3, \n\nPassage: The total number of active military personnel in the Croatian Armed Forces stands at 14,506 and 6,000 reserves working in various service branches of the armed forces.

                    "Passage: Fresh off their win over the Jaguars, the Bears stayed at home for a Week 15 Thursday night battle with the New Orleans Saints.  Chicago immediately got the lead as free safety Danieal Manning returned the game's opening kickoff 83 yards for a touchdown.  The Saints would respond in the second quarter with quarterback Drew Brees compleing a 2-yard touchdown pass to running back Pierre Thomas, yet the Bears answered with rookie running back Matt Fort&#233; getting a 1-yard touchdown run, while quarterback Kyle Orton got a 6-yard touchdown run. New Orleans would begin to rally in the third quarter as Thomas got a 42-yard touchdown run.  In the fourth quarter, the Sains took the lead as kicker Garrett Hartley made a 30-yard field goal, along with Brees completing an 11-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marques Colston.  Afterwards, Chicago replied with a game-tying 28-yard field goal from kicker Robbie Gould.  In overtime, the Bears clinched the victory as Gould nailed the game-winning 35-yard field goal. With the win, Chicago kept its playoff hopes alive by improving to 8-6.\nQuestion: How many yards was the longest rushing touchdown?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 42, \n\nPassage: 97.7% of the population were in households, 2.3% were in group quarters, and 1% were institutionalized. There were 8,103,731 households of which 30.2% or 2,449,343 had children. 46.1% or 3,736,165 were composed of opposite sex and married couples. Male households with no wife composed 4.9% or 400,534. 15.0% or 1,212,436 were female households, with no husbands. 34% or 2,754,596 were non-family households. The household density was 684 per square mile. 91.9% of housing units were occupied with a 3.8% vacancy rate. The average household size was 2.65 per household. The average income for non-family households was $90,335, and the average income for families was $104,715. 13.3% or 2,888,493 of the population were below the poverty line.\nQuestion: How many households had no children?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 5654388\n\nPassage: The return of Steve Hutchinson had the 12th man at Qwest Field in a frenzy. A knee injury to Matt Hasselbeck early in the second half silenced them. An early 72-yard touchdown reception by Darrell Jackson staked the Seahawks to a 7-3 lead, but the Vikings scored a TD of their own in the second quarter and the teams went to the half tied at 10. On the Hawks first possession of the 3rd quarter, Vikings LB E.J. Henderson rolled onto Hasselbeck's right leg and sent the QB to the turf well after he had released the ball. Hasselbeck left the field with the assistance of trainers, and did not return. Seneca Wallace took over at QB, completing  14 of 25 passes with two interceptions and a fumble in his own endzone. The Hawks gave up a 15-yard TD pass from RB Mewelde Moore to TE Jermaine Wiggins to trail 17-10 as Hasselbeck was walking to the locker room. They looked to have weathered the storm and recaptured momentum when punter Ryan Plackemeier pinned the Vikings on their own 5-yard line. The next play resulted in the Vikings' longest ever TD play, a 95-yard romp by Chester Taylor that brought back memories of Bo and the Boz. Suddenly the deficit was 14 points. The Hawks drove for an FG to cut the lead to 11, but a failure to convert a 4th and 1 play on the next drive ended any hope of pulling out the game. The loss ended the Seahawks' 12-game winning streak at home. An MRI scan on Hasselbeck's knee revealed a second degree sprain and he missed 4 games. With the loss, the Seahawks fell to 4-2 and their 12-game winning streak at home was snapped.\nQuestion: How long was the second longest touchdown play?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 72-yard\n\nPassage: The total number of active military personnel in the Croatian Armed Forces stands at 14,506 and 6,000 reserves working in various service branches of the armed forces.

                    "Passage: Coming off their impressive Thursday night road win over the Patriots, the Jets flew to LP Field for a Week 12 duel with the undefeated Tennessee Titans.  In the first quarter, New York took flight early as QB Brett Favre completed a 10-yard TD pass to RB Thomas Jones.  In the second quarter, the Jets continued their scoring as kicker Jay Feely got a 20-yard field goal.  The Titans closed out the half with kicker Rob Bironas getting a 43-yard field goal. In the third quarter, New York went back to work as Feely made a 30-yard field goal, while Favre completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles.  In the fourth quarter, Tennessee tried to rally as Bironas nailed a 49-yard field goal, yet the Jets replied with RB Leon Washington's 61-yard TD run.  The Titans tried to keep their perfect season alive as QB Kerry Collins completed a 6-yard TD pass to FB Ahmard Hall.  Afterwards, New York flew away as Washington got another 4-yard TD run. With the win, the Jets improved to 8-3. Favre also broke a tie with Dan Marino for victories in the most NFL stadiums by winning in his 32nd at LP Field.\nQuestion: How many touchdown passes did Brett Favre make in the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2\n\nPassage: The Philadelphia Eagles headed into Week 15 of the 2017 NFL Season at 11-2. With them clinching the NFC East in Week 14 in a win against the Rams, the Eagles were now fighting for the 1st seed in the NFC playoffs, home-field advantage, and a first-round bye. This was the first week that the Eagles played without MVP-candidate, Carson Wentz after he went down with a torn ACL in Week 14 which ended his season. Backup quarterback, Nick Foles led the Eagles offense for his first time since 2014. The Eagles quickly fell behind 6-0 in the first few minutes of the 1st as Eli Manning and the New York Giants marched down the field and scored on their opening possession. The Eagles responded with a 3-yard pass from Nick Foles to Alshon Jeffery and went up 7-6. Towards the end of the 1st, the Giants scored again with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Tavarres King to put them up 13-7. In the beginning of the second quarter, the Giants continued to show dominance as Eli Manning threw a 67-yard touchdown pass to put the Giants up 20-7. Nick Foles and the offense would eventually close the gap to bring the Eagles within two points at halftime with the Giants leading 23-21. The Eagles would eventually take the lead off of a 28-yard field goal from Jake Elliot to put them up 24-23. In the middle of the fourth, Nelson Agholor caught a 10-yard pass from Nick Foles which gave the Eagles a 31-23 lead. The Giants responded with a score of their own, a 57-yard touchdown pass to Tavarres King which cut the Eagles lead to 31-29. In the fourth, Jake Elliott hit a 20-yard field goal to put the Eagles up 34-29. The Eagles won the game 34-29 on a last minute defensive stop in their own territory. Despite the win, the defense played a terrible game against a woeful Giants team. With this win, the Eagles improved to a league-best 12-2 and clinched a first-round bye for the first time since 2004.\nQuestion: How many yards were gained on the last two touchdowns scored?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 67\n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their disastrous home loss to the Lions, the Broncos traveled to the O.co Coliseum for an AFC West rematch with the Oakland Raiders. In the first quarter, the Raiders grabbed the early lead, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Sebastian Janikowski. The Broncos responded, with quarterback Tim Tebow hooking up with wide receiver Eric Decker on a 27-yard touchdown pass. The Raiders re-claimed the lead in the second quarter, with quarterback Carson Palmer throwing two touchdown passes: an 11-yarder to running back Michael Bush, followed by a 40-yarder to fullback Marcel Reece. In the third quarter, the Broncos cut into the Raiders' lead, with a 26-yard touchdown pass from Tebow to wide receiver Eddie Royal. The Raiders responded, with Palmer throwing an 18-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jacoby Ford, giving Oakland a 24-14 lead. However, the Broncos would dominate the remainder of the game, beginning with a 43-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater, followed by running back Willis McGahee rushing for a 60-yard touchdown at the end of the third quarter. The Broncos grabbed the lead with six minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, when Royal returned a punt 85 yards for a touchdown, then pulled away with a 24-yard touchdown run by McGahee.\nQuestion: Which team scored the last points?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Broncos, \n\nPassage: The total number of active military personnel in the Croatian Armed Forces stands at 14,506 and 6,000 reserves working in various service branches of the armed forces.

They eventually took the lead when Roethlisberger found Martavis Bryant on a 19-yard TD pass to make it a 14-7 game.  The Ravens came within 4 as Justin Tucker kicked a 46-yard field goal to make it 14-10 game.  However, the Steelers would manage to go ahead by 12 before halftime when Roethlisberger found Markus Wheaton on a 47-yard TD pass followed by a successful 2-point conversion for a 22-10 lead at halftime.  After a scoreless 3rd quarter, the Steelers came out strong and went back to work in the 4th when Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 54-yard TD pass making the score 29-10.  The Ravens responded with a big play as Jacoby Jones ran a 108-yard kickoff return for a TD to make it a 29-17 game. Roethlisberger found Bryant again on an 18-yard TD pass to make the score 36-17.  This was followed by the Ravens trying their hand at coming back when Flacco found Crockett Gillmore on a 1-yard TD pass (with a failed 2-point conversion) for a 36-23 score.  But the Steelers were able to seal the game when Roethlisberger found Matt Spaeth on a 33-yard TD pass for a final score of 43-23. A week after passing for a franchise-record six touchdowns against Indianapolis, Roethlisberger duplicated the feat to lead Pittsburgh to its third consecutive win. The 12 touchdown passes over the last two games broke the NFL record of 11 set by Tom Flores for Oakland in the AFL in 1963 and matched by New England's Tom Brady in 2007.\nQuestion: How many more yards was Roethlisberger's longest touchdown pass compared with his shortest?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 49\n\nPassage: Many of the migrants from China in the 19th century came to work on the pepper and Uncaria gambir plantations, with 11,000 Chinese immigrants recorded in one year. Singapore became one of the entry and dispersal points for large number of Chinese and Indian migrants who came to work in the plantations and mines of the Straits Settlements, many of whom then settled in Singapore after their contract ended. By 1860, the total population had reached around 90,000, of these 50,000 were Chinese, and 2,445 Europeans and Eurasians. The first thorough census in Singapore was undertaken in 1871, and the people were grouped into 33 racial, ethnic or national categories, with Chinese forming the largest group at 57.6%. Censuses were then conducted at 10 year intervals afterwards. The 1881 census grouped the people into 6 main categories, and further subdivided into 47 sub-categories. The 6 broad groups were given as Europeans, Eurasians, Malays, Chinese, Indians and Others in 1921. The Malays group includes other natives of the Malay archipelago, the Europeans include Americans, the Indians would be people from the Indian subcontinent including what would now be Pakistan and Bangladesh. In 1901, the total population of Singapore was 228,555, with 15.8% Malays, 71.8% Chinese, 7.8% Indians, and 3.5% Europeans and Eurasians. The Chinese population figure of Singapore has stayed at over 70% of the total since, reaching 77.8% in 1947. After dropping from a peak of 60% in the early years of Singapore, the Malay population would range between 11 and 16% in the first half of the 20th century, while Indians hovered between 7 and just over 9% in the same period.\nQuestion: How many more Malays lived in Singapore in 1901 compared to Indians?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 8\n\nPassage: Colombia has well-developed air routes and an estimated total of 984 airports, 100 of which have paved runways, plus two heliports. Of the 74 main airports, 20 can accommodate jet aircraft. Two airports are more than 3,047 meters in length, nine are 2,438\u20133,047 meters, 39 are 1,524\u20132,437 meters, 38 are 914\u20131,523 meters, 12 are shorter than 914 meters, and 880 have unpaved runways. The government has been selling its stake in local airports in order to allow their privatization. The country has 40 regional airports, and the cities of Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn, Cali, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cartagena, C\u00facuta, Leticia, Pereira, San Andr\u00e9s, and Santa Marta have international airports.

                    "Passage: Coming off their road win over the Bills, the Jets went home for Week 10 interconference duel with the St. Louis Rams.  In the first quarter, New York took flight as RB Thomas Jones got a 13-yard TD run, kicker Jay Feely nailed a 22-yard field goal, and LB Calvin Pace returning a fumble 50 yards for a touchdown.  In the second quarter, the Jets continued their domination as Jones got a 2-yard TD run, Feely making a 49-yard and a 46-yard field goal, QB Brett Favre completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Dustin Keller, and Feely getting a 55-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, the Rams would get only points of the game as kicker Josh Brown nailed a 37-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, New York flew away as Jones got a 6-yard TD run. The +44 point differential marked the largest margin of victory in franchise history.  Also, it was their first win over the Rams since 1983.\nQuestion: How many teams scored during the third quarter?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1\n\nPassage: Hoping to build on their win over the Bills, the Lions flew to The Meadowlands and took on the New York Jets.  From the get-go, Detroit trailed early as N.Y. RB Leon Washington got a 5-yard TD run, while QB Chad Pennington completed a 44-yard TD pass to WR Justin McCareins.  In the second quarter, the Lions got on the board with QB Jon Kitna completing a 22-yard TD pass to WR Roy Williams.  However, the Jets responded with RB Kevan Barlow running three yards for a touchdown.  In the third quarter, New York continued to fly high as kicker Mike Nugent completed a 33-yard field goal.  Even though Detroit would get another touchdown, with Kitna completing a 9-yard TD pass to RB Kevin Jones, the \"Gang Green\" would finish off the Lions with Washington's 16-yard TD run.  With the loss, Detroit heads into its Bye Week at 1-6.\nQuestion: Who made the only TD pass under 10 yards?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Jon Kitna\n\nPassage: Coming off their road win over the Rams, the Panthers would play their Week 2 homeopener against the Houston Texans. In the first quarter, Carolina pounced first with QB Jake Delhomme hooking up with WR Steve Smith on a 7-yard TD pass and a 12-yard TD pass. The Texans would respond with QB Matt Schaub completing a 31-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson. In the second quarter, Houston continued its pounding with Schaub and Johnson hooking up with each other again on a 9-yard TD pass, along with kicker Kris Brown's 25-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Panthers continued to struggle as Texans RB Ahman Green got a 13-yard TD run, while Carolina FB Nick Goings fumbled during a kickoff return. The ball would roll into the endzone, where Houston WR Kevin Walter would land on it for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, the Texans would put the game well out of reach with Brown's 33-yard field goal. The Panthers tried to get a comeback with Delhomme and Smith hooking up with each other on an amazing 74-yard TD pass, but the deficit was too much to overcome.\nQuestion: How many yards longer was Matt Schaub's first touchdown compared to Jake Delhomme's first touchdown?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 24\n\nPassage: The total number of active military personnel in the Croatian Armed Forces stands at 14,506 and 6,000 reserves working in various service branches of the armed forces.

                    "Passage: Sir Ralph Moore and the Royal Niger Company had planned the attack on the Aros and the Ibini Ukpabi oracle since September 1899 but due to lack of necessary manpower, it was delayed until November 1901. On November 28, Lt. Col. Arthur Forbes Montanaro led 87 officers, 1,550 soldiers and 2,100 carriers in four axes of advance to Arochukwu from Oguta, Akwete, Unwana and Itu on a counter-insurgency campaign. As expected, Aro forces resisted all axes strongly, although they lacked modern weapons. However, Arochukwu was captured on December 28 after four days of fierce battles in and around the city. As a result, the Ibini Ukpabi shrine was allegedly blown up. Battles between British and Aro forces continued throughout the region until spring 1902 when Aro forces were defeated in the last major battle at Bende. The Aro Expedition ended three weeks later.\nQuestion: Who was in charge of the forces fighting against The Aro?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Lt. Col.

The Cowboys trailed early with RB Chris Ivory getting a 3-yard TD run, followed by kicker Garrett Hartley getting a 50-yard field goal, and then by Ivory making a 6-yard TD run. The Cowboys cut the lead as kicker David Buehler got a 21-yard field goal, but the Saints replied as Hartley nailed a 45-yard field goal. The Cowboys tried to come back as Buehler hit a 53-yard field goal, followed by Miles Austin getting a 60-yard TD run. The Cowboys trailed further with Hartley making a 28-yard field goal, but took the lead with Marion Barber III and Tashard Choice getting a 1-yard TD run. They failed to maintain this lead when QB Drew Brees completed a 12-yard TD pass to WR Lance Moore.\nQuestion: WHO HOSTED IN THE SAINTS IN THEIR ANNUAL THANKS GIVING DAY GAME\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3-yard, \n\nPassage: The 100th Shipborne Fighter Aviation Regiment  was formed at Saki in the Crimea on 10 March 1986. In January 1992 its personnel refused to take the oath of loyalty to Ukraine, which would have presumably made them part of the Ukrainian Navy or Ukrainian Air Force, and instead its personnel left for Russia, leaving their aircraft and equipment behind. The unit regrouped at Severomorsk-3 as part of the Northern Fleet. However, in February 1993 the regiment was disbanded and its personnel and equipment incorporated into the 279th Shipborne Fighter Aviation Regiment. The 279th Independent Shipborne Assault Aviation Regiment was established in 1973. In 1990 it became a Maritime Assault Aviation Regiment.

                    "Passage: According to the Yuanshi, the Yuan fleet set out with an estimated 15,000 Mongol and Chinese soldiers and 1,600-8,000 Korean soldiers in 300 large vessels and 400-500 smaller craft along with several thousand sailors, although figures vary considerably depending on the source and many modern historians consider the numbers exaggerated. The primary port for the operation was Quanzhou in Fujian, then the center of China's maritime trade. They landed on Komodahama beach on Tsushima Island on October 5, 1274. S\u014d Sukekuni, governor of Tsushima, led a cavalry unit of 80 to defend the island, but he and his outnumbered unit were killed in the engagement. The Mongols and Koreans subsequently invaded Iki. Tairano Takakage, the Governor of Iki, fought the invaders with about 100 of his cavalrymen, but he killed himself after his unit was defeated. The Mongol forces landed on November 19 in Hakata Bay, a short distance from Dazaifu, the ancient administrative capital of Ky\u016bsh\u016b. The following day brought the Battle of Bun'ei , also known as the \"First Battle of Hakata Bay\". The Japanese coalition force opposing them included 120 armed samurai each with a warband and likely numbered between 3,000 and 6,000 strong. Later accounts have both sides believing themselves to be drastically outnumbered by the enemy; the Yuanshi provides an estimate of 102,000 for the Japanese force, while the Japanese Hachiman Gudokun describes the invaders as outnumbering the Japanese 10 to 1. Conlan argues that the Yuanshi's account of the battle suggests that both the Japanese and Yuan forces were of similar size. Conlan estimated that both armies numbered around 3,000 each .\nQuestion: What day did the Battle of Bun'ei take place?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 20 November 1274\n\nPassage: As of the census of 2000, there were 61,676 people, 23,291 households, and 15,115 families residing in the county.

It also came in the form of a 41-yard TD pass to WR Bernard Berrian and a 31-yard TD pass to TE Desmond Clark. The Lions only score of the game came in the form of QB Jon Kitna getting a 1-yard QB sneak for a TD in the third quarter. The Bears put the game well-out of reach, as a 5-yard TD to TE John Gilmore later in the quarter and a 45-yard field goal by Gould in the fourth quarter sealed Detroit's fate. With the loss, the Lions dropped to 0-2.\nQuestion: How many yards was the first field goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 32, \n\nPassage: In 2000 there were 128,925 households in Toledo, out of which 29.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.2% were married couples living together, 17.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 40.0% were non-families. 32.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 11.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

The Broncos grabbed the early lead in the first quarter, with a 39-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. However, the Lions would dominate the remainder of the game, beginning with a 41-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford to wide receiver Titus Young, followed in the second quarter by a 50-yard field goal by placekicker Jason Hanson, a 1-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to tight end Tony Scheffler and a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Maurice Morris, giving Detroit a 24-3 halftime lead. The Lions continued their domination in the third quarter, with a 24-yard fumble return for a touchdown by defensive end Cliff Avril, a 56-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to wide receiver Calvin Johnson, followed in the fourth quarter by cornerback Chris Houston returning an interception off Broncos' quarterback Tim Tebow 100 yards for a touchdown. The Broncos finally got into the end zone, with Tebow throwing a 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Eric Decker, but the outcome of the game had already been decided in Detroit's favor.\nQuestion: Which team won the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Lions, \n\nPassage:  Coming off a bye week, the Bears battled rival Detroit Lions on Monday Night Football.

                    "Passage: The amazing December turnaround of the Philadelphia Eagles continued with another road win over a division rival. Philadelphia's surprising 23-7 Christmas Day victory over the Dallas Cowboys was broadcast on national television and clinched a playoff spot. Jeff Garcia, who outshined fellow backup-turned starting quarterback Tony Romo, led the Eagles to scores on four of their first five possessions. Capping off their first drive, which took 7:12 off the clock, Garcia hit tight end Matt Schobel for a 25-yard touchdown. Cowboys' return man Miles Austin fumbled the ensuing kickoff to Quintin Mikell. However, Dallas cornerback Anthony Henry intercepted Garcia and the Cowboys drove to the Eagles' 1-yard line. From there, the Philadelphia defense stuffed Dallas goal-line back Marion Barber III on three straight plays. The ball turned over on downs and Garcia promptly found Dont&#233; Stallworth for a 39-yard gain. The drive finished with a David Akers field goal and the Eagles led 10-0. Romo and the Cowboys responded with a 14-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens, who only caught two passes for 23 yards on the game. With only&#160;:29 seconds left in the half, Garcia got the Eagles into field goal range, and David Akers connected on a 45-yarder to make it 13-7 as time expired. On the opening drive of the third quarter, Garcia beat a Dallas blitz and completed a 65-yard catch and run to L.J. Smith. Philadelphia finished the drive with another field goal and it was 16-7. Early in the fourth quarter, Brian Dawkins made an over the shoulder interception in front of Owens in the end zone. On a 6:57 drive that included ten running plays and broke the Cowboys' backs, Correll Buckhalter pounded it in from one yard out, increasing the lead to 23-7. Romo would throw another interception, this one to Lito Sheppard, and the Eagles' domination of the Dallas offense continued for the rest of the game. The Eagles ran the ball a whopping 42 times for 204 yards (with Brian Westbrook accounting for 122 of those yards), while Garcia and the passing game gained 238 yards. The defense recorded three sacks in addition to the two interceptions and held Dallas to a meager 201 total yards on their own turf. Philadelphia clinches a playoff berth, and now suddenly controls the NFC East and can win the division with a win over the Atlanta Falcons or a Dallas loss. With another victory, the Eagles moved up to 9-6.\nQuestion: Which team lost the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Cowboys, \n\nPassage: For the third straight game, the Niners jumped out to an early lead, only to be shut out for the remainder of the game. And for the second straight game, mistakes and penalties allowed their opponent to take the victory. The Niners had pulled out to a 14-6 lead with 5:07 remaining in the second quarter, but saw the Cardinals score 17 unanswered points for a 23-14 victory. The Niners failed to score the last six times they had the ball, and racked up nine penalties for 107 yards, most in the second half.\nQuestion: Who scored more points, Cardinals or Niners?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Cardinals, \n\nPassage: In a rematch of their only loss so far this season, the Patriots faced the Buffalo Bills in a road game. After taking the opening kick, the Bills raced 70 yards all the way to the Patriots 5, but the Patriots defense kept Buffalo out of the end zone, forcing them to kick a 23-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Walt Powell forced Matthew Slater to fumble, but Shea McClellin recovered for the Patriots at their own 30. The Patriots drained over half of the remainder of the first quarter, going 70 yards to score on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Amendola. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots were given good field at the Bills 45. An offensive pass interference penalty on Amendola moved the ball back to the Patriots 45, but a holding penalty on Robert Blanton of the Bills moved the ball to mid field. A two-yard run by Blount and incomplete pass brought up a 3rd-and-8 from the Bills 48, and Brady hit Edelman with a 47-yard bomb to the 1-yard line, but the gain was nullified on an ineligible man downfield penalty on Marcus Cannon moving the ball back to the Patriots 47. Then Brady hit Hogan on a 53-yard touchdown bomb, increasing the lead to 14-3. Four possessions later, the Bills raced 59 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on a Mike Gillislee 3-yard touchdown rush. After Amendola returned the ball 24 yards to the Patriots 21, the Patriots countered, using just four plays and Brady found Gronkowski on a 53-yard touchdown, increasing the lead to 21-10. The Bills raced 44 yards in 11 plays to the Patriots 31 on their ensuing possession, but Carpenter missed a 49-yard field goal after it hit the upright. Taking over at their own 39, a 6-yard pass to White, a 15-yard pass to Amendola, and a 7-yard pass to Edelman led the Patriot to Bills 33 and Gostkowski kicked a 51-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 24-10 lead at halftime. Amendola kicked off the second half with fireworks, returning the kick 73 yards to the Bills 24. Two plays later, Brady hit Edelman for a 12-yard touchdown pass, extending the lead to 31-10. The Bills didn't quit, though, using a marathon 75-yard, six minute drive, concluding with Taylor splitting the defense for a 26-yard touchdown run, making it a game again with a 31-17 score. The Patriots countered right back, engineering an 11-play, 75-yard drive with LeGarrette Blount chalking up a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 38-17 late in the third quarter. Using Reggie Bush 35 yard kick return, the Bills drove 50 yards to the Patriots 10 in just 4 plays, but on the first play of the fourth quarter, a Taylor pass bounced off the fingertips of Charles Clay and the Bills turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots put the game away on their next drive, marching 76-yards in 13 plays, taking 7:49 off the clock, with Gostkowski adding a 32-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 41-17 lead with just 7:06 remaining in the game. The Bills drove 52 yards to the Patriots 32 on their next drive, but turned the ball over on downs when Robert Woods was tackled 1-yard short of the first down by Malcolm Butler. The Bills forced a Patriots punt and raced 66 yards in 6 plays, scoring a touchdown on a 1-yard touchdown run by Jonathan Williams with a two-point conversion on a two-yard pass from backup quarterback EJ Manuel to Nick O'Leary trimming the score to 41-25, but only 0:30 remained. After recovering the onside kick, the Patriots took a knee to win the game. Brady was 22/33 for 315 yards and had four touchdown passes to four different receivers (Danny Amendola, Chris Hogan, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman); LeGarette Blount added a running touchdown and Stephen Gostkowski a field goal. Heading into their bye week, the Patriots improved to 7-1, the best record in the league.\nQuestion: How many field goals did Gostkowski score total?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2, \n\nPassage:  Coming off a bye week, the Bears battled rival Detroit Lions on Monday Night Football. The team kept the Lions from scoring until the fourth quarter, and forced four takeaways. The first turnover forced was in the first half, when Lance Briggs stripped the ball from Mikel Leshoure, which was recovered by Julius Peppers.

                    "Passage: The Eagles donned their throwback uniforms (in celebration of the franchise's 50th Anniversary of their 1960 championship team) and began their season at home for an NFC duel with the Green Bay Packers.  In the first quarter, Philadelphia had the early lead with kicker David Akers making a 45-yard field goal, but failed to maintain it in the second quarter with Packers kicker Mason Crosby nailing a 49-yard field goal, followed by quarterback Aaron Rodgers throwing  a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Donald Driver, followed by Crosby hitting a 56-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Green Bay fullback John Kuhn pushed up the middle for a 3-yard touchdown run, but replied with running back LeSean McCoy running in a 12-yard TD run. However, the Packers extended their lead with Rodgers bombing a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings. The Eagles cut the lead in the 4th quarter with quarterback Michael Vick tossing a 17-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jeremy Maclin, and with Akers nailing a 24-yard field goal, but couldn't do enough, giving the Eagles a loss. With the loss, the Eagles began the season at 0-1. They also lost Leonard Weaver, who was considered to be the best fullback in the NFL in 2009 and had just been signed to a record-breaking fullback, to a career ending injury.\nQuestion: What are the two longest touchdown passes?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 32-yard, 17-yard\n\nPassage: Looking to muster their first winning streak of the season, the Washington Redskins took on the rival New York Giants on Monday Night Football. To add to the fanfare, Redskins owner Daniel Snyder hired Bruce Allen to be the new General Manager. However, the Redskins came out flat, and trailed 24-0 by halftime. With a chance to kick a field goal as the half ended to cut it to a 24-3 deficit, the Redskins tried one of the most ill-advised and ill-fated fake field goal attempts of all-time. Redskins P Hunter Smith sent the entire offensive line in motion, along with K Graham Gano. The first attempt was foiled by a Giants time-out. The second attempt was intercepted and almost taken back for a 31-0 lead. In the 2nd half, the Redskins finally got on the board, scoring on a touchdown pass to Fred Davis. However, it was too little, too late, as K Graham Gano missed the extra point. The Redskins would not score again until it was 38-6 Giants. RB Quinton Ganther scored on a 2-yard scamper, but the Redskins came up a foot short on the 2-point conversion, which sealed any slim chance there was of a comeback. When all was said and done, the Giants won 45-12. With the crushing loss, Washington fell to 4-10, losing 10 games or more for the third time in six seasons.\nQuestion: How many points did the Giants win by?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 33, \n\nPassage: Following a tough overtime loss to the Cowboys, the Chiefs flew to FedExField for a Week 6 interconference duel with the Washington Redskins. After a scoreless first quarter, Chiefs kicker Ryan Succop booted a 39-yard field goal for the only score of the half.In the third quarter, the Redskins took the lead with a 40-yard and a 28-yard field goal from kicker Shaun Suisham, but Kansas City tied it up with Succop's 46-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Succop gave the Chiefs the lead with a 46-yard and a 24-yard field, but it was the defense that closed the game out for Kansas City, as DE/OLB Tamba Hali sacked quarterback Todd Collins in his own end zone for a safety with under a minute to play.\nQuestion: How many field goals did the Chiefs score in the first half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 1, \n\nPassage:  Coming off a bye week, the Bears battled rival Detroit Lions on Monday Night Football.

                    "Passage: Coming off their divisional road win over the 49ers, the Cardinals played their Week 2 home opener against the Miami Dolphins. In the first quarter, the Cardinals scored first as QB Kurt Warner threw 2 touchdown passes (a 79-yarder and a three-yarder) to WR Anquan Boldin. In the second quarter, Arizona increased their lead with a 45-yard field goal by Neil Rackers. In the third quarter, the Cardinals increased its lead to 24-0 with rookie running back Tim Hightower getting a one-yard touchdown run. In the process, he became the first Cardinals rookie running back to ever score in each of his first two games. The Dolphins finally got on the board when kicker Dan Carpenter nailed a 32-yard field goal. The Cardinals replied with Warner and Boldin hooking up with each other for a third time on an eight-yard touchdown pass. In the fourth quarter, Miami tried to rally as running backRonnie Brown got a one-yard TD run, but Arizona held on for a dominating win. With the win, the Cardinals improved to its first 2-0 start since 1991. This game was also one of three times that Kurt Warner finished a game with a perfect passer rating.\nQuestion: Who threw the second longest TD pass?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Kurt Warner\n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Bengals, the Panthers returned home for a Sunday night match-up with the Dallas Cowboys.  In the first quarter, Carolina started off strong with a 1-yard TD run by DeShaun Foster.  The Panthers would even have QB Jake Delhomme complete a 24-yard TD pass to WR (Steve Smith).  In the second quarter, the Cowboys started to play catch-up.  QB Tony Romo completed a 3-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten and kicker Mike Vanderjagt would complete a 38-yard field goal.  Unfortunately, after a scoreless third quarter, the Panthers squandered their early lead in the fourth quarter.  It came it the form of Vanderjagt kicking a 24-yard field goal, RB Julius Jones getting a 14-yard TD run (with Romo hooking up WR Terrell Owens on the two-point conversion), a 3-yard TD run by RB Marion Barber, and Barber getting a 14-yard TD run.  With their loss, the Panthers entered their Bye Week at 4-4.\nQuestion: Who made a TD pass to Steve Smith?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: QB Jake Delhomme, \n\nPassage: Coming off their overseas trip to London and subsequent bye week, the Broncos donned their alternate orange jerseys and returned home for an AFC West duel against the Kansas City Chiefs, hoping to snap a 4-game losing streak. In the first quarter, quarterback Kyle Orton, playing on his 28th birthday, threw three touchdown passes: a 17-yarder to running back Knowshon Moreno, a 6-yarder to wide receiver Brandon Lloyd and a 40-yarder to wide receiver Jabar Gaffney. In the second quarter, quarterback Tim Tebow ran for a 1-yard touchdown, followed by linebacker Jason Hunter returning a fumble 75 yards for a touchdown, giving the Broncos a commanding 35-0 lead before the two-minute warning. The Chiefs got on the board, with a 5-yard touchdown run from running back Jamaal Charles, followed by a 40-yard field goal by placekicker Ryan Succop just before halftime. In the third quarter, Tim Tebow threw his first touchdown pass&#8212;a 3-yarder to fullback Spencer Larsen, but the Chiefs responded, with quarterback Matt Cassel throwing a 15-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Dwayne Bowe. In the fourth quarter, Orton threw his fourth touchdown pass of the game&#8212;a 15-yarder to Lloyd. The Chiefs responded, with Cassel throwing a pair of touchdown passes&#8212;an 11-yarder to wide receiver Chris Chambers, followed by a 22-yarder to Bowe (both with failed two-point conversion attempts), but the outcome had already been decided in the Broncos' favor.\nQuestion: How many total touchdown passes did Kyle Orton throw?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 4, \n\nPassage:  This game involved a scary moment, after Seattle's  Ricardo Lockette was hit during a kick return.

                    "Passage: The Rams began their 2007 campaign at home against the Carolina Panthers.  In the first quarter, St. Louis trailed early as Panthers QB Jake Delhomme completed a 10-yard TD pass to WR Drew Carter.  The Rams would tie the game with QB Marc Bulger completing a 3-yard TD pass to WR Torry Holt.  In the second quarter, St. Louis would take the lead with kicker Jeff Wilkins getting a 42-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the third quarter, Wiklins helped the Rams' lead with a 28-yard field goal.  However, this was all wiped out as Delhomme completed a 68-yard TD pass to WR Steve Smith.  In the fourth quarter, Carolina took over for the remainder of the game as kicker John Kasay nailed a 34-yard field goal, Delhomme and Carter hooked up with each other again on a 9-yard TD pass, and Kasay finished the game with 32-yard field goal. The game was notable when offensive tackle Orlando Pace suffered a season-ending injury. This severely hurt the Rams' offense.\nQuestion: Which player had the highest average yards of field goals?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Wiklins\n\nPassage: The immigrant population (those with two foreign-born parents) in Bergen, includes 42,169 individuals with backgrounds from 180 countries representing 15.5% of the citys population (2014). Of these, 50.2% have background from Europe, 28.9% from Asia, 13.1% from Africa, 5.5% from Latin America, 1.9% from North America, and 0.4% from Oceania. The immigrant population in Bergen in the period 1993-2008 increased by 119.7%, while the ethnic Norwegian population grew by 8.1% during the same period. The national average is 138.0% and 4.2%. The immigrant population has thus accounted for 43.6% of Bergens population growth and 60.8% of Norways population growth during the period 1993-2008, compared with 84.5% in Oslo.\nQuestion: Which country does has the immigrant population accounted for more of the population growth, Bergen or Norway?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Norways\n\nPassage: Coming off their Monday night loss to the Saints, the Patriots traveled to Miami to face the Dolphins with a two-game lead in the division. The Patriots received the ball to start the game and six plays in, converted a 3rd-and-8 to keep the drive alive. On the next play, Brady threw a 58-yard touchdown pass to Moss to take an early 7-0 lead. Brady was injured on the play and went to the locker room but returned by the next offensive snap. In the mean time, the Dolphins' first possession reached the Patriots' 42-yard line before Henne was sacked by Banta-Cain and Mayo for a loss of seven yards. On the next play, the Dolphins used White in their \"pistol\" formation and attempted a play action option run, but White's option toss to Ricky Williams was errant and recovered by Williams for a loss of 13 yards. Following the Dolphins' punt, the Patriots began a 13-play, 80-yard drive with 6:41 left in the first quarter and did not surrender the ball until early in the second quarter, extending their lead to 14-0 on a 6-yard Faulk draw for a touchdown. The Dolphins responded with a 10-play, 88-yard drive of their own, including a 29-yard pass to Camarillo, that ended in a 13-yard touchdown pass from Henne to Davone Bess, cutting the Patriots' lead to 14-7. Despite a 16-yard Welker reception to begin the Patriots' next drive, they were forced to punt after four plays. The Dolphins again moved into Patriots territory on their ensuing possession, reaching the 49-yard line before Henne was intercepted by Meriweather at the Patriots' 19-yard line. Following a 19-yard return, a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Wilfork, and a false start penalty on Watson, the Patriots' next drive began at their own 18-yard line. The Patriots quickly moved into the red zone on a 58-yard Welker catch, but on a 4th-and-1 from the 6-yard line, the Patriots tried to convert, and Morris was stopped short of the first down marker. Off the turnover and with under two minutes remaining, the Dolphins moved 83 yards on 11 plays, cutting the Patriots' halftime lead to 14-10 on a 29-yard Carpenter field goal. The Dolphins, who had deferred the opening coin toss, chose to receive at the start of the second half but went three-and-out. On the next play (after a penalty), Brady threw a short sideline pass to Aiken, who caught the ball over the defender and proceeded to run down the sideline for an 81-yard touchdown, extending the Patriots' lead to 21-10. It was the third 50+ yard completion of the game for Brady, a career first, and the third longest completion of Brady's career. He also eclipsed 30,000 career passing yards on the play. Following a 51-yard kickoff return by Ted Ginn, Jr., the Dolphins took two plays to reach Patriots territory. On a 3rd-and-4 from the Patriots' 46-yard line, Henne attempted a deep sideline pass to wide receiver Brian Hartline, who stopped and turned back to catch the ball but was taken down by Wilhite for a 37-yard defensive pass interference penalty. However, the Pats surrendered only three yards and forced the Dolphins to kick a field goal; Carpenter's 24-yard score cut the Patriots' lead to 21-13. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Dolphins continued to pressure the Patriots defense, moving 64 yards on 12 plays and cutting the deficit to two points on a 7-yard Hartline touchdown catch. The Dolphins attempted to tie the game on a two-point conversion pass attempt to Fasano, but the pass fell incomplete. The Patriots' next drive reached the Dolphins' 39-yard line, where the Patriots again attempted to convert a fourth down, this one with three yards to gain. The Patriots appeared to do so at first, as Welker caught a 13-yard pass from Brady, but the play was nullified by an Aiken offensive pass interference penalty. After another penalty on the first punt attempt, the second punt attempt by Hanson actually gave the Patriots a better break, pinning the Dolphins at their own 3-yard line at the end of the third quarter. The Dolphins could not move past their 22-yard line on the ensuing possession and punted, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 39-yard line. After several quick first downs, the Patriots reached the red zone. However, a Brady pass attempt intended for Moss in the back corner of the end zone was intercepted by Vontae Davis for a touchback, maintaining a two-point deficit for the Dolphins. However, the Dolphins could not move a yard off the turnover and were forced to punt; the Patriots too went three-and-out. The Dolphins moved to the Patriots' 39-yard line on their ensuing possession, and like the Patriots, faced a fourth down with two yards to go. Henne's pass intended for Bess was broken up by Butler to turn the ball over on downs. However, the Patriots did not gain a yard, and in fact lost one yard on their next possession, setting up a Dolphins possession with 3:44 left in the game. The Dolphins moved 51 yards on 10 plays, reaching the Patriots' 23-yard line with just over one minute remaining. Carpenter then hit a 41-yard field goal to put the Dolphins ahead for the first time in the game, 22-21. Only needing a field goal, the Patriots tried to set up a Gostkowski attempt with under a minute to go, but three plays into their drive Brady was hit as he threw and was intercepted by linebacker Channing Crowder to seal a Dolphins victory. The back-to-back losses were a first for the Patriots since November 2006, and dropped their record to 7-5, while the Dolphins improved to 6-6 and within a game of first place in the division.\nQuestion: How many points did the Patriots score in the second quarter?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 7, \n\nPassage:  This game involved a scary moment, after Seattle's  Ricardo Lockette was hit during a kick return. He lied on the ground, motionless, for about 7 minutes before he was taken off the field on a cart. X-rays later revealed that Lockette had a broken neck. The injury ended his career. The Cowboys would only kick field goals in this game, as Dan Bailey was 4 for 4 on field goals. Dallas lead 12-10 with under 2 minutes to go. However, the Seahawks would march down the field and would take a 13-12 lead after Steven Hauschka drilled a 24-yard field goal.

                    "Passage: Coming off their dominating divisional road win over the Raiders, the Broncos played their Week 2 home opener against the AFC West foe, the San Diego Chargers.  In the first quarter, Denver was first out of the gate as FB Michael Pittman got a 1-yard TD run.  The Chargers would respond with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 34-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Denver replied with QB Jay Cutler completing a 3-yard and a 14-yard TD pass to TE Tony Scheffler.  San Diego would immediately respond with RB Darren Sproles returning the kickoff 103 yards for a touchdown, yet the Broncos replied with rookie kicker Matt Prater getting a 52-yard field goal.  The Chargers would strike as their lead as QB Philip Rivers completed a 48-yard TD pass to WR Chris Chambers, yet Denver retaliated with Cutler completing a 6-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Marshall. In the third quarter, San Diego started to rally as Rivers completed a 15-yard TD pass to Chambers, and Kaeding kicked a 21-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Chargers took the lead with Kaeding's 28-yard field goal and Rivers' 66-yard TD pass to Sproles. Fortunately, the Broncos responded with a 12-play, 80-yard drive (which included a controversial officiating call that turned a Cutler fumble into an incomplete pass) that was capped off with Cutler's 4-yard TD pass to rookie WR Eddie Royal, followed by Cutler's successful 2-point conversion pass to Royal. Brandon Marshall's 18 receptions would become a single-game franchise record and tie for 2nd most in league history.\nQuestion: How many more field goals did Kaeding kick compared with Prater?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2\n\nPassage: In their first road game of the season, the Broncos traveled to Orchard Park, New York to face the Buffalo Bills. After a 38-yard field goal by Broncos' placekicker Brandon McManus gave the Broncos the lead late in the first quarter, the Bills grabbed the lead, with a 2-yard touchdown from quarterback Tyrod Taylor to wide receiver Andre Holmes on a deflected pass. The Broncos responded, when running back Jamaal Charles eluded Bills' defenders for a 12-yard touchdown &#8212; Charles' first touchdown as a Bronco. The Broncos were attempting to add to their lead on their next possession, however, a 44-yard pass completion from quarterback Trevor Siemian to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders was overturned by a Bills' challenge, as replay indicated that Sanders did not maintain full control of the football at the Bills' 44-yard line as cornerback Tre'Davious White knocked the ball out. McManus and Bills' placekicker Steven Hauschka proceeded to alternate field goals, with a 28-yarder by McManus giving the Broncos a 16-13 lead midway through the third quarter. However, the Broncos were held scoreless for the remainder of the game, and the Bills took the lead for good, with Taylor connecting with tight end Charles Clay on a 6-yard touchdown pass. A 53-yard field goal by Hauschka extended the Bills' lead to 23-16 early in the fourth quarter. The Broncos drove to as far as the Bills' 24-yard line on their first possession of the fourth quarter, however, Siemian was intercepted by White. Five plays later, the Broncos' defense forced an incomplete pass off Taylor at the Broncos' 46-yard line, hoping to receive the football back after a punt. However, linebacker Von Miller was flagged for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty in which he offered to help Taylor off the turf, then pulled his hand back. After the Bills earned three first downs and forced the Broncos to use all of their team timeouts, Hauschka added a 27-yard field goal with 3:18 remaining in the game. The Broncos had one last offensive possession, but did not advance past the Bills' 42-yard line. Prior to this game, 32 Broncos' players decided to kneel during \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" after President Donald Trump made comments about the national anthem protests two days prior.\nQuestion: How many field goals Hauschka kicked?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3, \n\nPassage: In week 5, the Lions hosted the defending Super Bowl Champion Pittsburgh Steelers. The Lions scored first with a 46-yard Jason Hanson field goal. The Steelers responded with a 7-yard TD run by Rashard Mendenhall. The Lions replied with another 46-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Pittsburgh scored first with a 15-yard TD catch by Heath Miller from Ben Roethlisberger. The Lions retaliated with a 38-yard interception run for a touchdown by William James. Hines Ward of the Steelers next got a touchdown of his own, a 17-yard catch, making the halftime score 21-13 Pittsburgh. After the break, Mike Wallace of Pittsburgh caught a 47-yard TD pass. The final score of the game was a 25-yard catch by Detroit's Dennis Northcutt. Lions backup QB Daunte Culpepper was sacked 7 times in the loss, 3 of which were on consecutive downs.\nQuestion: How many points was the highest margin of victory in any of the games?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 16\n\nPassage:  This game involved a scary moment, after Seattle's  Ricardo Lockette was hit during a kick return. He lied on the ground, motionless, for about 7 minutes before he was taken off the field on a cart. X-rays later revealed that Lockette had a broken neck. The injury ended his career.

                    "Passage: In May 1959 the first major steps to prepare infiltration routes into South Vietnam were taken; Group 559 was established, a logistical unit charged with establishing routes into the south via Laos and Cambodia, which later became famous as the Ho Chi Minh trail. At about the same time, Group 579 was created as its maritime counterpart to transport supplies into the South by sea. Most of the early infiltrators were members of the 338th Division, former southerners who had been settled at Xuan Mai from 1954 onwards. Regular formations were sent to Southern Vietnam from 1965 onwards; the 325th Divisions 101B Regiment and the 66th Regiment of the 304th Division met US forces on a large scale, a first for the PAVN, at the Battle of Ia Drang Valley in November 1965.

The Lithuanian Army moved to secure territories abandoned by the retreating Polish forces. They took Turmantas on July 7, Tauragnai and Alanta on July 9, \u0160irvintos and Musninkai on July 10, Kernav\u0117, Mol\u0117tai, and Giedrai\u010diai on July 11, Mai\u0161iagala and Pabrad\u0117 on July 13. On July 13 the Polish command decided to transfer Vilnius to the Lithuanians in accordance with the resolution of the Spa Conference. Lithuanians moved in, but their trains were stopped by Polish soldiers near Kazimieri\u0161k\u0117s. This delay meant that the Bolsheviks were the first to enter Vilnius on July 14. By the time first Lithuanian troops entered the city on July 15, it was already secured by the Soviets. Poland sought to have Russians in the city as it would create much less complications when Polish Army counterattacked. Despite the Peace Treaty, the Soviets did not intend to transfer the city to the Lithuanians. Indeed, there were indications that the Soviets planned a coup against the Lithuanian government in hopes to re-establish the Lithuanian SSR. Despite the setback in Vilnius, the Lithuanians continued to secure territories in the Suwa\u0142ki Region. They took Druskininkai on July 17, Vi\u0161tytis, Punsk, Giby, and Sejny on July 19, Suwa\u0142ki on July 29, August\u00f3w on August 8. The Polish units, afraid of being surrounded and cut off from the main Polish forces, retreated towards \u0141om\u017ca. The Lithuanian authorities started to organize themselves in the regained areas.\nQuestion: How many cities did the Lithuanians take on July 19?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 4, \n\nPassage: The United Kingdom Census 2001 revealed that the borough had a population of 263,464 - of whom 127,806 were male, and 135,658 female. Of those stating a choice, 47.71% described themselves as Christian, 17.71% as Hindu, 12.26% as Muslim and 10% as having irreligion. Of the population, 39.96% were in full-time employment and 7.86% in part-time employment - compared to a London average of 42.64% and 8.62%, respectively. Residents were predominantly owner-occupiers, with 23.17% owning their house outright, and a further 31.33% owning with a mortgage. 10.59% were in public housing, with a further 13.29% renting from a housing association, or other registered social landlord.\nQuestion: How many percent of people were not in public housing?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 88.41\n\nPassage:  This game involved a scary moment, after Seattle's  Ricardo Lockette was hit during a kick return. He lied on the ground, motionless, for about 7 minutes before he was taken off the field on a cart. X-rays later revealed that Lockette had a broken neck. The injury ended his career. The Cowboys would only kick field goals in this game, as Dan Bailey was 4 for 4 on field goals. Dallas lead 12-10 with under 2 minutes to go. However, the Seahawks would march down the field and would take a 13-12 lead after Steven Hauschka drilled a 24-yard field goal. Dallas tried to come back, but Seattle forced a turnover on downs to end the game.\nQuestion: Who scored more  points Seahawks or Cowboys?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

                    "Passage: Coming off a season-sweeping road win over the Jets, the Bills went home for a Week 9 intraconference duel with the Cincinnati Bengals.  with rookie QB Trent Edwards out for a sore right wrist, J. P. Losman got the chance to reclaim his starting job. In the first quarter, Buffalo drew first blood with Losman completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Lee Evans that was initially ruled incomplete.  The Bengals would respond with QB Carson Palmer completing a 15-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh.  In the second quarter, the Bills went back into the lead with kicker Rian Lindell getting a 23-yard field goal.  However, Cincinnati immediately responded with WR/KR Glenn Holt returning the kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown.  Buffalo ended the half with Lindell kicking a 21-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bills went back to work with Lindell getting a 21-yard field goal.  However, the Bengals answered with Palmer completing a 1-yard TD pass to FB Jeremi Johnson.  Fortunatenly, in the fourth quarter, Buffalo began its final assault with Lindell nailing a 38-yard field goal.  Afterwards, rookie RB Marshawn Lynch was a key player as he threw an 8-yard TD pass to TE Robert Royal on a trick play, along with getting his best run of the year with a 56-yard TD run. With the win, not only did the Bills improve to 4-4, but they have won three-straight games for the first time since 2004. Losman ended the day completing 24 out of 34 passes for 295 yards with a touchdown and an interception.  Meanwhile, Lynch finally managed to get not only his first 100-yard game, but also his first 150-yard game.  He ended the day with 29 carries for 153 yards and a touchdown, along with his touchdown pass.\nQuestion: How many yards was the longest scoring play?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 100\n\nPassage: On Monday Night Football, the Bears traveled west to face the 2-6 San Diego Chargers. The two teams last met in 2011 at Soldier Field, the Bears winning 31-20, though their last meeting in San Diego was in 2007, which the Chargers won 14-3, and the last MNF game in San Diego was a Chargers 20-7 victory in 1984; in eleven games, the Bears led the series 6-5. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears offense could capitalize on a defense that allowed the most yards after the catch in the NFL. Additionally, offenses often started drives at 32-yard line, ranked 31st in the league, while the Chargers also had the least points off turnovers with seven. The Chargers were also allowing 6.34 yards per play, the second-worst in the NFL. To attack, the offense would balance passes that focused on favorable receiver/cornerback matchups and run with Jeremy Langford, who was making his first career start with Matt Forte out. Defensively, the Bears faced an offense struggling with injuries, particularly at the line: of the five positions, four have seen two or more players starting. However, quarterback Philip Rivers excelled despite the injuries, having thrown for 18 touchdowns and 7.9 yards per pass, both of which were among the highest in the NFL; Rivers' performance had also enabled him to be in position to overtake Peyton Manning's single-season passing yards record. The Chargers had the top-ranked offense in the NFL, and also ranked first in yardage after the catch. Another offensive player that the Bears faced was tight end Antonio Gates, who led the league in career touchdowns with 101. However, the San Diego running game was struggling, with 3.6 rushing yards per play, which ranked 30th in the league. Special teams-wise, both teams were among the worst in the NFL: the Chargers were ranked 30th in average return yardage allowed, while the Bears were 31st; the former also allowed a league-high ten returns of 30-39 yards. For the Chargers' punt return unit, they had only one yard in 2015. San Diego also had league-worsts in starting yard line after kickoffs with 19.3 yards, drives starting within their own 20-yard line (11) and average starting area (21). Forte, receiver Eddie Royal, safety Harold Jones-Quartey, Shea McClellin, Hroniss Grasu, Tayo Fabuluje and defensive lineman Ziggy Hood were inactive. The Chargers won the coin toss and elected to kick off. Despite reaching the Chargers' 28-yard line, two scoring opportunities were denied with Jason Verrett deflecting Jay Cutler's pass for Alshon Jeffery and Robbie Gould's field goal sailing wide left. Afterwards, the Chargers scored with Danny Woodhead's 14-yard touchdown catch from Rivers. On the Bears' next possession, the offense entered Charger territory again, reaching as far as the 10-yard line, where Cutler was sack-stripped by Melvin Ingram, with the ball being recovered by Eric Weddle, though the Chargers failed to capitalize and punted. After the Bears punted as well, they reclaimed the ball when Tracy Porter stripped Dontrelle Inman and linebacker Christian Jones recovered. However, after two plays, Verrett intercepted Cutler's pass for Jeffery, returning it 68 yards for the touchdown; the Chargers eventually missed the extra point, making the score 13-0. On the next drive, Cutler threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett. After both teams exchanged punts, the Chargers scored the final points of the first half with Josh Lambo's 31-yard field goal. In the second half, after the Chargers punted, Gould's 34-yard field goal attempt hit the left upright. San Diego punted again, and the Bears engineered a 93-yard drive that culminated with Langford scoring on a one-yard run. The Chargers increased the margin to five points with Lambo kicking a 22-yard field goal. Guiding an 80-yard drive, Cutler threw a 25-yard pass to tight end Zach Miller, who caught the pass with one hand as he scored the go-ahead touchdown. Afterwards, Langford scored on the two-point conversion. The Chargers' final drive fell apart with plays like Lamarr Houston's two sacks, and on 4th down and 23, Rivers' deep pass fell incomplete. With 1:09 left in the game, Cutler kneeled three times to end the game. With Cutler's touchdown to Bennett, he overtook Sid Luckman for the most passing touchdowns in franchise history with 138. Additionally, his final touchdown marked his twelfth fourth quarter touchdown, the most in the league. Miller's touchdown catch was his first since the 2011 season.\nQuestion: How many total points were scored during the 2011 matchup?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 51\n\nPassage: Springfield has had professional baseball in the past, and according to its current mayor, remains intent on pursuing it in the future. The Springfield Giants of the Single\u2013 and Double-A Eastern League (baseball) played between 1957 and 1965. The team was quite successful, winning consecutive championships in 1959, 1960 and 1961, by startling coincidence the same seasons in which the Springfield Indians won three straight Calder Cup championships in hockey. The Giants played at Pynchon Park by the Connecticut River until relocating after the 1965 season. Pynchon Parks grandstands were destroyed by fire the year after in 1966. Before that time, the Springfield Cubs played in the minor league New England League from 1946 until 1949, after which the league folded; they then played in the International League until 1953. For many years before the Giants, Springfield was also a member of the Eastern League, between 1893 and 1943. In general, the team was named the Springfield Ponies, but it also carried the nicknames of \"Maroons\" (1895), \"Green Sox\" (1917), \"Hampdens\" (1920\u201321), \"Rifles (1932, 1942\u201343) and \"Nationals\" (1939\u201341). The team located closest are the Valley Blue Sox of the New England Collegiate Baseball League who play their games in nearby Holyoke, but house their team offices at 100 Congress Street in Springfield.\nQuestion: How many years did the Springfield Giants play?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 8\n\nPassage:  This game involved a scary moment, after Seattle's  Ricardo Lockette was hit during a kick return.

                    "Passage: For about three centuries, the Qing dynasty had enforced\u2014albeit with mixed success\u2014a policy of segregating the non-Han peoples  on the frontier from Han Chinese. By the end of the 19th century, however, China faced the prospect of being parcelled out among the Western powers and Japan, each competing for its own sphere of influence in the country. On the northern frontier, Russian Empire was viewed by the Qing court as posing the greatest threat to its territorial integrity. In response, the Qing government adopted a different policy, the \"New Administration\" or \"New Policies\" , which called for the sinification of Mongolia through Chinese colonisation, the exploitation of Mongolia's natural resources , military training, and education. Many Mongols regarded the \"New Policies\" as a major threat to their traditional way of life, as was agreed to be preserved when they recognised authority of the Qing emperors, and began to seek independence. In July 1911 a group of Khalkha nobles persuaded the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, the head of Mongolian Buddhism , that Mongolia must declare its independence from the Qing dynasty. They agreed to send a small delegation to Russia to obtain its assistance in this undertaking. In October 1911 revolution broke out in China, with one province after another declaring its independence from the Qing government. On 1 December 1911 Outer Mongolia declared independence, and established a theocracy under the Khutuktu. On 29 December he was installed as the Bogd Khaan  of Mongolia. This ushered in the Bogd Khaan era, which lasted from 1911 to 1919.\nQuestion: How many years did the Bogd Khaan era last?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 8\n\nPassage: He represented the Liberal party at the Norwegian Parliament (Storting) 1886-1888 and again in 1892-1898.

In the first quarter, Pittsburgh came out strong as QB Ben Roethlisberger completed a 17-yard TD pass to TE Heath Miller and a 15-yard TD pass to WR Santonio Holmes.  In the second quarter, the Steelers increased their lead with Roethlisberger completing a 30-yard TD pass to WR Nate Washington, a 35-yard TD pass to Holmes, and a 7-yard TD pass to Washington.

He lied on the ground, motionless, for about 7 minutes before he was taken off the field on a cart. X-rays later revealed that Lockette had a broken neck. The injury ended his career. The Cowboys would only kick field goals in this game, as Dan Bailey was 4 for 4 on field goals. Dallas lead 12-10 with under 2 minutes to go. However, the Seahawks would march down the field and would take a 13-12 lead after Steven Hauschka drilled a 24-yard field goal.

From 2000 Greece saw high levels of GDP growth above the Eurozone average, peaking at 5.8% in 2003 and 5.7% in 2006. The subsequent Great Recession and Greek government-debt crisis, a central focus of the wider European debt crisis, plunged the economy into a sharp downturn, with Real gross domestic product GDP growth rates of \u22120.3% in 2008, \u22124.3% in 2009, \u22125.5% in 2010, \u22129.1% in 2011, \u22127.3% in 2012 and \u22123.2% in 2013. In 2011, the countrys government debt reached \u20ac356 billion (172% of nominal GDP). After negotiating the biggest debt restructuring in history with the private sector involvement, Greece reduced its sovereign debt burden to \u20ac280 billion (137% of GDP) in the first quarter of 2012. Greece achieved a real GDP growth rate of 0.7% in 2014\u2014after 6 years of economic decline\u2014but contracted by 0.3% in 2015 and by 0.2% in 2016. The country returned to modest growth of 1.5% in 2017.\nQuestion: Which year had the lowest negative percentage with GDP growth rates: 2011 or 2012?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2011\n\nPassage:  This game involved a scary moment, after Seattle's  Ricardo Lockette was hit during a kick return. He lied on the ground, motionless, for about 7 minutes before he was taken off the field on a cart. X-rays later revealed that Lockette had a broken neck. The injury ended his career. The Cowboys would only kick field goals in this game, as Dan Bailey was 4 for 4 on field goals. Dallas lead 12-10 with under 2 minutes to go. However, the Seahawks would march down the field and would take a 13-12 lead after Steven Hauschka drilled a 24-yard field goal. Dallas tried to come back, but Seattle forced a turnover on downs to end the game.\nQuestion: How many field goals did the Cowboys make?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer:",

In the first quarter, Cleveland trailed early as Rams RB Steven Jackson got a 2-yard TD run, along with QB Marc Bulger completing a 1-yard TD pass to WR Torry Holt. The Browns responded with kicker Phil Dawson getting a 35-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Cleveland took the lead with QB Derek Anderson completing a 12-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards and a 21-yard TD pass to TE Kellen Winslow.

Boris Savinkov was at the head of an army of 20,000 to 30,000 largely Russian POWs, and was accompanied by Dmitry Merezhkovsky and Zinaida Gippius. The Polish forces grew from approximately 100,000 in 1918 to over 500,000 in early 1920. In August 1920, the Polish army had reached a total strength of 737,767 soldiers; half of that was on the frontline. Given Soviet losses, there was rough numerical parity between the two armies; and by the time of the battle of Warsaw, the Poles might have even had a slight advantage in numbers and logistics.Among the major formations on the Polish side was the First Polish Army.\nQuestion: How many soldiers were in Polish forces in early 1920?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 500000, \n\nPassage: A meeting called by Count Plunkett on 19 April 1917 led to the formation of a broad political movement under the banner of Sinn F\u00e9in which was formalised at the Sinn F\u00e9in Ard Fheis of 25 October 1917. The Conscription Crisis of 1918 further intensified public support for Sinn F\u00e9in before the general elections to the British Parliament on 14 December 1918, which resulted in a landslide victory for Sinn F\u00e9in, winning 73 seats out of 105, whose MPs gathered in Dublin on 21 January 1919 to form D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and adopt the Declaration of Independence.\nQuestion: How many seats did Sinn F\u00e9in loose?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 32, \n\nPassage:  This game involved a scary moment, after Seattle's  Ricardo Lockette was hit during a kick return.

                    "Passage: The following year, the feud between the nobility and plundering by robber knights continued. In 1385, the castle of Ricklingen, where the Mandelslohs resided, was besieged. When a catapult threw a heavy rock at the troops of Duke Albert, he was hit, and died on 28 June 1385. In the wake of his death, Elector Wenceslas appointed Bernard, his brother-in-law, as co-regent involved him in the government. But his younger brother Henry did not agree with this ruling, and after vain attempts to reach an agreement, the fight flared up again in the spring of 1388. Elector Wenceslas had to assemble an army without the help of Bernard, supported by the town of L\u00fcneburg. From Winsen an der Aller, he wanted to attack Celle, which was held by Henry and his mother. During the preparations, however, Elector Wenceslas fell seriously ill and died shortly thereafter. According to legend, he was poisoned. L\u00fcneburg continued the preparations, formed an alliance with the Bishop of Minden and Count of Schaumburg and set up his own army. On 28 May 1388, battle was joined at Winsen an der Aller; it ended in victory for Henry. According to the provisions of the Treaty of Hanover from the year 1373, after the death of Wensceslas, the Principality passed to the House of Welf. In 1389, a inheritance agreement between the Welfs and the Ascanians was concluded, the treaty of 1374 was abolished, and the Principality was finally secured for the Welfs.\nQuestion: What happened last, Duke Albert's death or Elector Wenceslas' death?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Elector Wenceslas' death, \n\nPassage: The Titans' fourth game was an AFC duel with the Broncos at home ground.

The Broncos' kicker Matt Prater made a 36-yard field goal to give Denver a 3-point lead, but the Titans replied when kicker Rob Bironas nailed an incredible 55-yard field goal. In the 3rd quarter the Titans trailed slightly when Matt Prater made a 36-yard field goal, but after that, WR Marc Mariani returned the kickoff and ran 98&#160;yards to the endzone for a touchdown, giving the Titans the lead. The lead was narrowed when Prater made a 35-yard field goal, but was increased again when Bironas made a 46-yard field goal. In the 4th quarter Tennessee fell behind when QB Kyle Orton completed a 6-yard TD pass to RB Correll Buckhalter, followed by Prater making another 36-yard field goal.\nQuestion: Which players made at least two field goals?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Matt Prater, Rob Bironas\n\nPassage: On April 28, attorneys met with Santoro and said they made substantial progress on a revised plan. They reported having settled all disputes with Vicks creditors, including Joel. On August 27, Santoro approved the revised reorganization plan. It was supported by all of Vicks creditors but one who was owed $13,000. Every creditor was to be paid back in six years on the condition that an estimated $9 million in assets be liquidated. Vick was allowed annual living expenses of $300,000 under the plan. He could spend up to $3,500 a month for rent in Philadelphia and $750 for \"utilities and miscellaneous.\" He was to pay $3,712 a month on the mortgage for his house in Hampton, Virginia, where his fianc\u00e9e and two children lived, and could pay up to $1,355 per month in private school tuition for his children. Vick was also given up to $472 a month in car-related expenses. His mother was allowed $2,500 per month, and his former girlfriend Tameka Taylor was allotted $3,000 per month to support their son, Mitez. Vick was not required to pay creditors during his first season with the Eagles. Vick paid his agent, Joel Segal (sports agent), $32,500 in 2010, $104,000 in 2011, and would pay him $160,000 each year from 2012-2015 for a total of $776,500. He paid bankruptcy lawyers $748,750 in 2010, $1 million in 2011, and a total of $2.6 million.\nQuestion: How many dollars was Vick allowed to pay for rent and mortgage each month?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 6712\n\nPassage:  This game involved a scary moment, after Seattle's  Ricardo Lockette was hit during a kick return. He lied on the ground, motionless, for about 7 minutes before he was taken off the field on a cart. X-rays later revealed that Lockette had a broken neck. The injury ended his career. The Cowboys would only kick field goals in this game, as Dan Bailey was 4 for 4 on field goals. Dallas lead 12-10 with under 2 minutes to go. However, the Seahawks would march down the field and would take a 13-12 lead after Steven Hauschka drilled a 24-yard field goal.

In the first quarter, the Niners' struggles continued as Rams QB Marc Bulger completed a 3-yard touchdown reception to WR Torry Holt. San Francisco managed to respond with kicker Joe Nedney 28-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, St. Louis increased its lead with kicker Jeff Wilkins getting a 49-yard field goal for the only score of the period. After a scoreless third quarter, the Rams sealed the win with Wilkins kicking a 35-yard field goal. The Niners tried to mount a comeback as Nedney nailed a 38-yard and a 46-yard field goal. However, on four-straight plays deep in St. Louis territory, four shots to the endzone resulted in 3 incompletions and an interception.\nQuestion: Which player scored more field goals, Joe Nedney or Jeff Wilkins?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Joe Nedney\n\nPassage: The Cowboys hosted the Saints in their annual Thanksgiving Day game. The Cowboys trailed early with RB Chris Ivory getting a 3-yard TD run, followed by kicker Garrett Hartley getting a 50-yard field goal, and then by Ivory making a 6-yard TD run. The Cowboys cut the lead as kicker David Buehler got a 21-yard field goal, but the Saints replied as Hartley nailed a 45-yard field goal. The Cowboys tried to come back as Buehler hit a 53-yard field goal, followed by Miles Austin getting a 60-yard TD run. The Cowboys trailed further with Hartley making a 28-yard field goal, but took the lead with Marion Barber III and Tashard Choice getting a 1-yard TD run. They failed to maintain this lead when QB Drew Brees completed a 12-yard TD pass to WR Lance Moore.\nQuestion: WHO HOSTED IN THE SAINTS IN THEIR ANNUAL THANKS GIVING DAY GAME\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3-yard, \n\nPassage: At the start of the 1910s, the decade would begin with the Panic of 1910\u20131911 stifling economic growth for a lengthy period of time. History would later take its course on July 30, 1914; as the average stood at a level of 71.42 when a decision was made to close down the New York Stock Exchange, and suspend trading for a span of four and a half months. Some historians believe the exchange closed because of a concern that markets would plunge as a result of panic over the onset of World War I. An alternative explanation is that the Secretary of the Treasury, William Gibbs McAdoo, closed the exchange to conserve the U.S. gold stock in order to launch the Federal Reserve System later that year, with enough gold to keep the United States on par with the gold standard. When the markets reopened on December 12, 1914, the index closed at 74.56, a gain of 4.4 percent. This is frequently reported as a large drop, due to using a later redefinition. Reports from the time say that the day was positive. Following World War I, the United States would experience another economic downturn, the post-World War I recession. The Dows performance would remain unchanged from the closing value of the previous decade, adding only 8.26%, from 99.05 points at the beginning of 1910, to a level of 107.23 points at the end of 1919.\nQuestion: How many days was the New York Stock Exchange closed for?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 135\n\nPassage:  This game involved a scary moment, after Seattle's  Ricardo Lockette was hit during a kick return.

In the first quarter, the 'Bolts struck first as kicker Nate Kaeding got a 25-yard field goal, along with QB Philip Rivers completing a 49-yard TD pass to WR Malcom Floyd.  In the second quarter, the Patriots got on the board as kicker Stephen Gostkowski got a 47-yard field goal.

In the third quarter, the Chargers continued its victory march as Rivers completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates, along with Kaeding kicking a 35-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the 'Bolts closed out the night with Kaeding nailing a 35-yard field goal.

The Bengals tied it up in the second quarter when Randy Bullock kicked a 39-yard field goal to make it 3-3.  Though the Texans would then retake the lead when DeShaun Watson ran for a 49-yard touchdown to make it 10-3.  Bullock closed out the first half scoring with a 29-yard field goal to make it 10-6 at halftime.  In the third quarter, the Bengals went back to work when Bullock kicked a 30-yard field goal to get his team within a point making the score 10-9.  In the fourth quarter, the Texans moved ahead by 4 after Fairbairn kicked a 42-yard field goal to make it 13-9.  The Bengals tried to come back with seconds left but after a failed fourth down conversion attempt, the Texans were able to seal the victory. With the loss, the Bengals dropped to 0-2.

                    "Passage: Francis I of France had continued his policy of seeking a middle course in the religious rift in France until an incident called the Affair of the Placards.  The Affair of the Placards began in 1534, and started with protesters putting up anti-Catholic posters. The posters were not Lutheran but were Zwinglian or \"Sacramentarian\" in the extreme nature of the anti-Catholic content\u2014specifically, the absolute rejection of the Catholic doctrine of \"Real Presence.\"  Protestantism became identified as \"a religion of rebels,\" helping the Catholic Church to more easily define Protestantism as heresy. In the wake of the posters, the French monarchy took a harder stand against the protesters. Francis had been severely criticized for his initial tolerance towards Protestants, and now was encouraged to repress them.  At the same time, Francis was working on a policy of alliance with the Ottoman Empire.  The ambassadors in the 1534 Ottoman embassy to France accompanied Francis to Paris.  They attended the execution by burning at the stake of those caught for the Affair of the Placards, on 21 January 1535, in front of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. John Calvin, a Frenchman, escaped from the persecution to Basle, Switzerland, where he published the Institutes of the Christian Religion in 1536. In the same year, he visited Geneva, but was forced out for trying to reform the church. When he returned by invitation in 1541, he wrote the Ecclesiastical ordinances, the constitution for a Genevan church, which was passed by the council of Geneva.\nQuestion: How many years after John Calvin was forced out of Geneva did he return?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 5, \n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Steelers, the Bengals went home for a Week 13 AFC North rematch with the Baltimore Ravens.  In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Ravens kicker Matt Stover made a 27-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Baltimore increased its lead as Stover got a 21-yard field goal, along with QB Joe Flacco completing a 4-yard TD pass to TE Todd Heap.  The Bengals would close out the half as kicker Shayne Graham nailed a 21-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Ravens pulled away as WR Mark Clayton completed a 32-yard TD pass to WR Derrick Mason and caught a 70-yard TD pass from Flacco.  In the fourth quarter, Baltimore pulled away as safety Jim Leonhard returned an interception 35 yards for a touchdown. With the loss, not only did Cincinnati fall to 1-10-1.  They surpassed their 2007 loss total and were swept by the Ravens for the first time since 2002.\nQuestion: Which position scored the first points of the game?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: kicker, \n\nPassage: In 1574 the Captaincy General of the Philippines was created as a dependency of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. In 1584, the Real Audiencia of Manila is established by King Felipe II, who appointed as its President the same governor of the Captaincy General of the Philippines. The Captaincy had its capital in Cebu from 1565 to 1595, and in Manila from 1595 until 1898. As part of the extensive governmental reforms during the early Bourbon period throughout the overseas possessions, an Intendencia was established in Manila by Royal Decree of July 17, 1784 that handled issues regarding the government finances and to promote the economy. Ciriaco Gonz\u00e1lez Carbajal was appointed as Oidor of the Audiencia of Manila and was instructed to abide by the Royal Ordinance of Mayors of 1782, that had been enacted in Rio de la Plata. Carbajal proposed the establishment of more Intendencias in Ilocos, Camarines, Iloilo and Cebu, and although they were created on November 24, 1786, they were later abolished by the Royal Decree of November 20, 1787. A month earlier, on October 23, the Intendencia of Manila had been attached to the Captaincy General of the Philippines. Until 1822, all General Captains were civilians, but after that year they were always chosen among the military. Throughout the second half of the 19th century, there were established many dependent local government offices and military settlements, very numerous due to a large number of islands and the extent of the districts.\nQuestion: How many years was Cebu the capital of Captaincy?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 30, \n\nPassage: As of the census of 2000, there were 40,543 people, 15,416 households, and 11,068 families residing in the county.

                    "Passage: The return of Steve Hutchinson had the 12th man at Qwest Field in a frenzy. A knee injury to Matt Hasselbeck early in the second half silenced them. An early 72-yard touchdown reception by Darrell Jackson staked the Seahawks to a 7-3 lead, but the Vikings scored a TD of their own in the second quarter and the teams went to the half tied at 10. On the Hawks first possession of the 3rd quarter, Vikings LB E.J. Henderson rolled onto Hasselbeck's right leg and sent the QB to the turf well after he had released the ball. Hasselbeck left the field with the assistance of trainers, and did not return. Seneca Wallace took over at QB, completing  14 of 25 passes with two interceptions and a fumble in his own endzone. The Hawks gave up a 15-yard TD pass from RB Mewelde Moore to TE Jermaine Wiggins to trail 17-10 as Hasselbeck was walking to the locker room. They looked to have weathered the storm and recaptured momentum when punter Ryan Plackemeier pinned the Vikings on their own 5-yard line. The next play resulted in the Vikings' longest ever TD play, a 95-yard romp by Chester Taylor that brought back memories of Bo and the Boz. Suddenly the deficit was 14 points. The Hawks drove for an FG to cut the lead to 11, but a failure to convert a 4th and 1 play on the next drive ended any hope of pulling out the game. The loss ended the Seahawks' 12-game winning streak at home. An MRI scan on Hasselbeck's knee revealed a second degree sprain and he missed 4 games. With the loss, the Seahawks fell to 4-2 and their 12-game winning streak at home was snapped.\nQuestion: How many touchdowns of over 70 yards were there?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 2\n\nPassage: The Cowboys' fourteenth game was an NFC East rivalry rematch against the Redskins at home. In the first quarter the Cowboys took the lead with kicker David Buehler hitting a 42-yard field goal, followed by QB Jon Kitna throwing a 3-yard TD pass to WR Miles Austin; then Buehler made a 20-yard field goal to put Dallas up 13-0. The lead was narrowed when QB Rex Grossman completed a 19-yard TD pass to RB Ryan Torain, but the Cowboys increased their lead with Kitna making a 14-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten, followed by RB Tashard Choice getting a 3-yard TD run. The Redskins replied with Grossman getting a 10-yard TD pass to WR Santana Moss, but the Cowboys scored again with Buehler got a 20-yard field goal. Washington managed to tie the game with Grossman finding Moss and Cooley on a 5-yard TD pass. The Cowboys managed to get the win after Buehler made a 39-yard field goal, settling both records at 5-9.\nQuestion: How many points behind were the Redskins after Buehler's first 20-yard field goal?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 13, \n\nPassage:  The Oxford Olympics Study 2016 found that sports-related costs for the Summer Games since 1960 are on average USD 5.2 billion and for the Winter Games USD 3.1 billion. This does not include wider infrastructure costs like roads, urban rail, and airports, which often cost as much or more than the sports-related costs. The most expensive Summer Games are Beijing at USD 40-44 billion and the most expensive Winter Games are Sochi 2014 at USD 51 billion. As of 2016, costs per athlete are on average USD 599,000 for the Summer Games and USD 1.3 million for the Winter Games.

                    "Passage: K\u0117dainiai was attacked by the 2nd Riflemen Regiment of Lithuanian  Division . Lithuanian forces from Panev\u0117\u017eys, commanded by Jonas Variakojis, and from K\u0117dainiai numbered only about 200 men. Lithuanians withstood Red Army advance near K\u0117dainiai and with German support repelled it. On February 8, during the course of a reconnaissance mission, Povilas Luk\u0161ys became the first Lithuanian soldier to die in the war. On February 10, joint Lithuanian and German forces captured \u0160\u0117ta and forced the Red Army to retreat. The success of this operation lifted the Lithuanian army's morale and prevented the Red Army from encircling Kaunas from the north. On February 9, Soviet 7th Riflemen Regiment  took over Jieznas, south of Kaunas. The following day Lithuanian forces  from Prienai and Kaunas attacked before the Red Army could consolidate position, but were betrayed by their Russian commander and suffered a defeat: 18 Lithuanians were killed and 33 were taken prisoners. Lithuanians retreated, were reinforced by new Lithuanian and Saxon Volunteers, attacked again, and took Jieznas on February 13. The Soviets continued to push for Kaunas. The 3rd and 4th Riflemen Regiments  attacked Alytus on February 12. Germans did not engage in battle and retreated; not yet fully formed Lithuanian 1st Infantry Regiment could not withstand pressure from the Red Army and had to retreat towards Marijampol\u0117 and Prienai. Antanas Juozapavi\u010dius, the first Lithuanian officer to die in the wars, was killed during this battle. On the night of February 14-15, German forces and one company of the Lithuanians returned to Alytus and retook the city. Kaunas was defended and the front stabilized for a while. Soviets were ordered to abandon the offensive and maintain defensive position. This break allowed Lithuanians to better organize and train the volunteers.\nQuestion: Which happened first, the Lithuanian and German forces captured Seta or the 3rd and 4th Riflemen Regiments attacked Alytus?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Lithuanian and German forces captured Seta, \n\nPassage: The 1991 Washington Redskins season started with a franchise-record 11 straight victories.

On February 3, 1703 a major earthquake struck the town. More than 3,000 people died and almost all the churches collapsed; Rocca Calascio, the highest fortress in Europe was also ruined by this event, yet the town survived. LAquila was then repopulated by decision of Pope Clement XI. The town was rocked by earthquake again in 1706. The most serious earthquake in the history of the town struck on July 31, 1786, when more than 6,000 people died.

                    "Passage: The army defending Constantinople was relatively small, totaling about 7,000 men, 2,000 of whom were foreigners. At the onset of the siege, probably fewer than 50,000 people were living within the walls, including the refugees from the surrounding area.:32  Turkish commander Dorgano, who was in Constantinople in the pay of the Emperor, was also guarding one of the quarters of the city on the seaward side with the Turks in his pay. These Turks kept loyal to the Emperor and perished in the ensuing battle. The defending army's Genoese corps were well trained and equipped, while the rest of the army consisted of small numbers of well-trained soldiers, armed civilians, sailors and volunteer forces from foreign communities, and finally monks. The garrison used a few small-calibre artillery pieces, which nonetheless proved ineffective. The rest of the city repaired walls, stood guard on observation posts, collected and distributed food provisions, and collected gold and silver objects from churches to melt down into coins to pay the foreign soldiers. The Ottomans had a much larger force. Recent studies and Ottoman archival data state that there were about 50,000-80,000 Ottoman soldiers including between 5,000 and 10,000 Janissaries, *70 cannons:139-140 an elite infantry corps, and thousands of Christian troops, notably 1,500 Serbian cavalry that the Serbian lord \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107 was forced to supply as part of his obligation to the Ottoman sultan\u2014just a few months before, he had supplied the money for the reconstruction of the walls of Constantinople. Contemporaneous Western witnesses of the siege, who tend to exaggerate the military power of the Sultan, provide disparate and higher numbers ranging from 160,000 to 200,000 and to 300,000.\nQuestion: How many more is the maximum estimate of the number of Janissaries than Serbian cavalry?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 8500\n\nPassage: As of the 2010 census, the population of Tallahassee was estimated to be 181,376. There were 74,815 households, 21.3% of which had children under 18 living in them. 27.7% were married couples living together, 14.4% had a female householder with no husband, and 53.7% were non-families. 34.1% of all households were made up of individuals living alone and 6.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.23 and the average family size was 2.88. Children under the age of 5 were 5.5% of the population, persons under 18 were 17.2%, and persons 65 years or older were 8.1%. The median age was 26 years. For every 100 females, there were 89.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.7 males. 57.4% of the population was White, 35.0% Black, 3.7% Asian, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 1.3% some other race, and 2.3% two or more races. 6.3% were Hispanic or Latino of any race, and 53.3% were non-Hispanic White. For the period 2009\u20132013, the estimated median household income was $39,524, and the per capita income was $23,778. The number of persons below the poverty level was estimated at 30.2%.\nQuestion: Which households made up between 25% and 35%?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: married couples living together, individuals living alone\n\nPassage: The settlement of Akmoly, also known as Akmolinsky prikaz, was established on the Ishim River in 1830 as the seat of an okrug by a unit of the Siberian Cossacks headed by Fyodor Shubin. The name was possibly given after a local landmark\u2014Akmola literally means \"a white grave\" in Kazakh language\u2014although this theory is not universally accepted. In 1832, the settlement was granted town status and named Akmolinsk. The fairly advantageous position of the town was clear as early as 1863 in an abstract from the Geographic and Statistical Dictionary of the Russian Empire. It describes how picket roads and lines connected this geographic centre to Kargaly in the East, Aktau fort in the South and through Atbasar to Kokshetau in the West. In 1838, at the height of the great national and liberation movement headed by Kenesary Khan, Akmolinsk fortress was burned. After the repression of the liberation movement, the fortress was rebuilt. On 16 July 1863, Akmolinsk was officially declared an uyezd town. During the rapid development of the Russian capitalist market, the huge Saryarka \u2014 Steppe and Lakes of Northern Kazakhstan were actively exploited by the colonial administration. To draft regulation governing the Kazakh Steppe the Government of the Russian Empire formed Steppe Commission in 1865. On 21 October 1868, Tsar Alexander II of Russia signed a draft Regulation on governing Turgay Oblast (Russian Empire), Ural Oblast (Russian Empire), Akmolinsk Oblast (Russian Empire) and Semipalatinsk Oblast, Russias. In 1869, Akmolinsk external district and department were cancelled, and Akmolinsk became the centre of the newly established Akmolinsk Oblast (Russian Empire). In 1879, Major General Dubelt proposed to build a railway between Tyumen and Akmolinsk to the Ministry of Communications of Russia.

                    "Passage: Hoping to rebound from their Thursday night road loss to the Cowboys, the Packers went home for Favre's 250th (270th including playoffs) consecutive start, along with Green Bay's Week 14 interconference duel with the Oakland Raiders. After a scoreless first quarter, the Packers sliced away in the second quarter with rookie RB Ryan Grant getting a 6-yard TD run, while CB Will Blackmon returned a punt 57&#160;yards for a touchdown. The Raiders would end the half with their only score of the game as QB Josh McCown completed a 25-yard TD pass to WR Jerry Porter. In the third quarter, Green Bay took control with rookie Mason Crosby nailing a 44-yard field goal, QB Brett Favre completing an 80-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings, while Blackmon recovered an Oakland fumble in their endzone for a touchdown (making him the first player since Cincinnati's Lemar Parrish in 1974 to return a punt and a fumble for a touchdown in one game). In the fourth quarter, the Packers pulled away with Favre completing a 46-yard TD pass to TE Donald Lee. With the win, not only did Green Bay improve to 11-2, but they also clinched the NFC North division title. It was the Packers' 18th division title, along with their 24th playoff berth with three games remaining in the season - the second-fastest division title in team history. Blackmon was awarded NFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors for his performance.\nQuestion: Which players caught touchdown passes from Brett Favre?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: Greg Jennings, Donald Lee\n\nPassage: Hoping to rebound from a tough MNF road loss to the Chargers, the Jets went home, donned their New York Titans throwbacks, and played a Week 4 interconference duel with the Arizona Cardinals.  After a scoreless first quarter, New York would begin their explosive second quarter.  It began with QB Brett Favre completing a 12-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles.  It continued with CB Darrelle Revis returning an interception 32 yards for a touchdown.  Afterwards, New York kept its domination going with Favre completing a 34-yard TD pass to Coles, kicker Jay Feely getting a 20-yard field goal, Favre and Coles hooking up with each other for a third time on a 2-yard TD pass, and Feely kicking a 30-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Cardinals started to rally as RB Edgerrin James got a 4-yard and a 2-yard TD run, while RB Tim Hightower got a 1-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Jets answered with Favre completing a 17-yard TD pass to WR Jerricho Cotchery.  Arizona replied with QB Kurt Warner completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Anquan Boldin, yet New York continued its victory march as Favre completed a 40-yard TD pass to Cotchery.  The Cardinals tried to come back as Warner completing a 14-yard TD pass to WR Jerheme Urban, yet the Jets were able to close out the game as Favre threw his career-best sixth touchdown pass to rookie TE Dustin Keller from 24 yards out. In the final minute, Anquan Boldin suffered fractured paranasal sinuses as a result of a helmet-to-helmet collision. After witnessing the injury, Kurt Warner considered retirement, but remained to lead the Cardinals to Super Bowl XLIII. With the amazing win, New York went into the bye week at 2-2. The Jets' 34-second quarter points became a franchise record for the most points in any given quarter.  The defense was also impressive with 5 sacks and 7 turnovers.  Also, heading into the game, Favre was listed as questionable, due to an injury from MNF.  He improved to 6-1 in career games where he's listed as questionable.\nQuestion: How many offensive and defensive touchdowns did the Jets have in the first half?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 4, \n\nPassage: Coming off of their bye week, the Steelers traveled to East Rutherford, NJ to take on the Jets.  The Jets scored first in the first quarter when Nick Folk scored a 25-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead for the only score of that period.  The Steelers managed to tie it at first in the 2nd quarter followed by taking the lead with 2 other field goals as Suisham kicked field goals from 46, 33, and 48 yards out for scores of 3-3, 6-3, and 9-3 respectively.  The Jets tried to rally as Folk nailed a 39-yard field goal for a 9-6 score at halftime.  In the 2nd half, it was all Steleers as they pulled away when Ben Roethlisberger found Emmanuel Sanders on a 55-yard touchdown pass for a 16-6 lead in the 3rd quarter which was then followed up by Suisham's 32-yard field goal in the 4th quarter for a final score of 19-6.\nQuestion: How many second quarter field goals over 30-yards did Suisham kick in the second quarter?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 3\n\nPassage: As of the census of 2000, there were 40,543 people, 15,416 households, and 11,068 families residing in the county.

                    "Passage: Early evidence for proto-Chinese millet agriculture is Radiocarbon dating to about 7000 BC. The earliest evidence of cultivated rice, found by the Yangtze River, is carbon-dated to 8,000 years ago. Farming gave rise to the Jiahu culture (7000 to 5800 BC). At Damaidi in Ningxia, 3,172 Neolithic signs in China dating to 6000\u20135000 BC have been discovered, \"featuring 8,453 individual characters such as the sun, moon, stars, gods and scenes of hunting or grazing\". These pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese. Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 7000 BC, Dadiwan culture from 5800 BC to 5400 BC, Damaidi around 6000 BC and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BC. Some scholars have suggested that Jiahu symbols (7th millennium BC) were the earliest Chinese writing system. Excavation of a Peiligang culture site in Xinzheng county, Henan, found a community that flourished in 5,500 to 4,900 BC, with evidence of agriculture, constructed buildings, pottery, and burial of the dead. With agriculture came increased population, the ability to store and redistribute crops, and the potential to support specialist craftsmen and administrators. In late Neolithic times, the Yellow River valley began to establish itself as a center of Yangshao culture (5000 BC to 3000 BC), and the first villages were founded; the most archaeologically significant of these was found at Banpo, Xian.

                    "Passage: While facing disasters at the Eastern front, Mehmed III died on 20 December 1603 at the age of 37. The new sultan Ahmed I who was 13 years old appointed Cigalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha as the commander of the eastern army who marched from Istanbul 15 June 1604, a very late time for the campaigning season. Until he reached the front on 8 November 1604, the Safavid army had already captured Yerevan in June and advanced towards Kars before being stopped in Akhaltsikhe. Seeing the late season as an excuse, he did not counter-attack Abbas I and decided to stay in Van until the end of the winter. However, the Safavid advance forced him to march towards Erzurum. The inactivity created unrest among the Turkish ranks. His campaign of 1605 was unsuccessful, the forces he led towards Tabriz suffering defeat near the shore of Lake Urmia on 9 September 1605. This was the first Safavid pitched victory against the Ottomans in their history. In this battle Abbas I utilized his predominantly cavalry force to great advantage, decisively defeating the Ottomans, who suffered some 20,000 dead. Kose Sefer Pasha, Beylerbey of Erzurum, acted independently and was captured by Safavid forces. Ca\u011falo\u011flu had to withdraw to the fortress of Van and thence in the direction of Diyarbak\u0131r. He ordered the execution of Canbulato\u011flu H\u00fcseyin Pasha claiming he was late to reinforce the Ottoman army which caused a larger unrest. Sinan  died in the course of this retreat in December 1605 and Abbas I was able to liberate Ganja, Baku, Shirvan and Shamakhi in Azerbaijan in June 1606.\nQuestion: How many cities in Azerbaijan were liberated in June 1606?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 4, \n\nPassage: Coming off their bye week, the Raiders went home, donned their throwbacks, and played a Week 10 AFL Legacy game with the Kansas City Chiefs.

                    "Passage: The war had profound consequences on the health of soldiers. Of the 60\u00a0million European military personnel who were mobilised from 1914 to 1918, 8\u00a0million were killed, 7\u00a0million were permanently disabled, and 15\u00a0million were seriously injured. Germany lost 15.1% of its active male population, Austria-Hungary lost 17.1%, and France lost 10.5%. In Germany, civilian deaths were 474,000 higher than in peacetime, due in large part to food shortages and malnutrition that weakened resistance to disease. By the end of the war, starvation caused by famine had killed approximately 100,000\u00a0people in Lebanon. Between 5 and 10 million people died in the Russian famine of 1921. By 1922, there were between 4.5 million and 7 million homeless children in Russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from World War I, the Russian Civil War, and the subsequent famine of 1920-1922.

It was also the last of Louis XIV's wars to establish defensible borders and French supremacy in Europe, the most recent being the 1688-1697 Nine Years' War when France was unable to defeat the Grand Alliance. The 1697 Treaty of Ryswick was driven by mutual exhaustion and the recognition by Louis that he needed allies for a war over the Succession. Emperor Leopold initially refused to sign the Treaty since it left this issue unresolved; he reluctantly did so in October 1697 but most viewed Ryswick as only a pause in hostilities.\nQuestion: How many countries did the Spanish empire have possessions in besides Spain?\nAnswer with only the result, no explanations needed. \nAnswer: 4, \n\nPassage: Trying to rebound from their Monday Night road loss to the Seahawks, the Raiders went home for an AFC West rematch with the Denver Broncos.
